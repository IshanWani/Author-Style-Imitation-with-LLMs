Not a time on a clock, a watch, a schedule –  but a deeper time, a time woven into the very fabric of the café's worn armchairs, the chipped paint on the windowsill, the persistent hum of the refrigerator.  This feeling, this *knowing*, was all that mattered.\n",

First, it was the articles.  \"A\" and \"the\" –  gone, vanishing like chalk dust on a breeze.  A sentence like, \"The boy is tall,\" became simply, \"Boy tall.\"  A simplification, perhaps?  No.  It felt… shallower.  Emptier.\n",

Leaving behind a primal, almost animalistic communication.  A series of grunts and gestures.\n",

The imperfection, the brokenness, the very thing that defined his collection, now defied it.  A functioning clock amongst the defunct.  A silent rebellion.  Or perhaps, a subtle, persistent lie.  He considered adding a note to its catalogue entry: \"Possibly functional.  Further investigation required.\"  Then he thought:  \"Further investigation?  It's just a clock.\"  But then the *click* again, and the doubt returned.\n",

Something she couldn’t quite name, but something that felt, faintly, like a beginning.  Or perhaps, simply, a different kind of seeing.\n",

The paper was thick, cream-colored, the kind she wouldn’t buy, wouldn't even touch.

He sat on the worn Persian rug, his liver-colored fur the exact shade of the liver pâté Bernard, her husband, preferred, a fact that suddenly felt deeply symbolic, even ominous.  He'd been staring like this for seven minutes, according to the kitchen clock, which itself seemed to tick with a conspiratorial slowness.\n",

      "It began last Tuesday.  Bernard had come home smelling faintly of lilies and something else, something sharp and metallic, like the inside of a newly sharpened pencil.  He'd claimed a late meeting, but his tie was askew, his usually impeccable hair slightly mussed, and there was a tiny scratch on his cheekbone, barely visible unless the light hit it just so.  The lilies, a generous bouquet, felt…off.  Too showy, too apologetic.\n",

      "Since then, the staring had intensified.  He'd follow Bernard around the house, a silent shadow, his tail tucked low, his gaze unwavering.  He’d even started leaving tiny, meticulously arranged piles of his own excrement – not in the usual spots, mind you, but in strategic locations: by the antique grandfather clock, near Bernard's favorite armchair, once, inexplicably, inside a perfectly good shoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "This afternoon, Winston’s stare was directed at the framed photograph on the mantelpiece – Bernard and her, younger, happier, on a beach in Maine.

Not a gentle spin, not a wobble, but a frantic, almost violent rotation.  It did not point north.  Or south.  Or any direction recognizable to a sailor, for that matter.\\n\\nHe cleaned it.  He oiled it.  He cursed it.  The needle continued its dizzying dance.  \\n\\nThe other sailors, they shrugged.  \"Bad luck,\" one said, spitting tobacco juice.  Another, older, more superstitious, muttered something about the Devil\\'s own trinket.  \\n\\nHe tried it at night.  Same frantic gyration under the indifferent stars.  He tried it during a storm.  The needle seemed to mirror the chaotic waves, a miniature tempest within the brass circle.  \\n\\nHe kept it.  In his pocket.  A cold weight against his thigh.  \\n\\nLater, much later, after years at sea, after he\\'d seen things no man should see, after the compass itself had begun to rust, a small, almost imperceptible tremor in the needle.  A pause.  Then, a slow, deliberate swing.  It pointed – not north, not south, but straight down.  Towards the sea floor.  Towards something far, far below.\\n\\nThe librarian, Mildred, noticed it first on Tuesday. A slight discrepancy.  The Dewey Decimal number, 813.54, was now, inexplicably, 813.542.  A new decimal place.  A fraction of a change.  She checked the catalogue.  No change there. The book itself, a slim volume titled *Ephemeral Musings*, remained the same in its binding, its colour, the faint smell of aged paper. But inside…\\n\\nWednesday: a different title.  *Ephemeral Musings on the Nature of Impermanence.*  An added subtitle.  A subtle shift in font – a hair’s breadth thinner.  Mildred felt a prickle, a slight itch of unease, like a forgotten appointment.\\n\\nThursday:  The text itself. A paragraph, the third from the end, was gone.  Replaced by a single, perfectly formed sentence: *The library smells faintly of dust and regret.*  Mildred smelled the dust, yes, but the regret?  That was subjective.\\n\\nFriday:  The book was thicker.  Significantly thicker.  Pages she hadn’t seen before.  New chapters, new words, a new handwriting in the margins.  A small, almost childish script.  A single word repeated throughout:  *tomorrow.*\\n\\nSaturday:  Mildred stayed late.  She watched.  The quiet hum of the fluorescent lights, the ticking of the clock.  Eleven fifty-nine.  Midnight.  A faint rustling.  A shifting.  Not a breeze.  A rewriting.  She saw it.  The ink, moving, reforming.  A page turning, itself.\\n\\nSunday:  The book was empty.  Blank pages.  A pristine, untouched volume.  The Dewey Decimal number: 000.000.  Nothing.\\n\\nMonday:  Mildred returned to her usual tasks.  The catalogue.  The overdue notices.  The faint smell of dust and… something else.  A faint scent of possibility, perhaps.  Or perhaps just dust.  It was difficult to tell.  The library was, after all, a library.\\n\\nThe first letter arrived on Tuesday.  A plain white envelope.  No return address.  Inside, a typed note:  \"Dearest Elara,  The plums are ripening.  Think of me.\"  \\n\\nElara?  No one named Elara lived here.  Or anywhere near here, as far as she knew.  She checked her address, the street number, the zip code.  All correct.  \\n\\nThe second letter came a week later.  Same style, same lack of return address.  \"Elara, my dearest, the sea is restless tonight.  Do you feel it too?\"  Restless.  The sea.  Pretentious, she thought.  And slightly damp.\\n\\nThree more letters followed.  Each one more insistent, more… possessive.  \"Elara, my love…\"  \"Elara, come home…\"  \"Elara, I wait.\"  She considered throwing them away, unread.  But the growing intensity – the plums, the sea, the waiting – held a strange fascination.  A morbid curiosity, perhaps.  Or was it something else?  A faint, unsettling echo?\\n\\nOne day, she found herself staring at her reflection.  Did she see a flicker of something in her eyes?  A sadness?  A longing?  It was gone in a moment.  But the next letter arrived with a pressed forget-me-not tucked inside the envelope.  A real forget-me-not.  Not a particularly good one, slightly wilted.  But real.\\n\\nShe didn\\'t know what to do.  The letters continued, though now less frequent.  She never replied.  The plums, the sea, Elara… all faded, eventually, into the background noise of her life.  Except for the forget-me-not.  That she kept.  Pressed between the pages of a book.  A book she rarely opened.\\n\\nThe café was closing.  The proprietor, a woman with hands like worn leather,  had swept the crumbs –  a precise, almost ritualistic sweeping.  Twice.  He remained.\\n\\nHe sat.  A chipped mug, lukewarm tea.  The light, failing.  Outside, the streetlights flickered on, a cold, impersonal glow.  She said, \"Monsieur?\"  Her voice, a low hum, the sound of a closing door.\\n\\nHe did not look up.  He stirred his tea.  A single, pale leaf circled slowly, a tiny, exhausted swimmer.  \"Not yet,\" he murmured.  The word hung, weightless, in the air, thick with the smell of old coffee and damp wool.\\n\\nShe sighed, a sound like air escaping a punctured tire.  It was a sound he knew well.  The sound of deadlines missed, of promises broken, of time itself, slipping away.  He understood the sigh, but did not understand its relevance to *him*.\\n\\nHe had a feeling.  A feeling about the *time*.  Not a time on a clock, a watch, a schedule –  but a deeper time, a time woven into the very fabric of the café\\'s worn armchairs, the chipped paint on the windowsill, the persistent hum of the refrigerator.  This feeling, this *knowing*, was all that mattered.\\n\\nThe proprietor, she left.  The door clicked shut.  He was alone.  Almost.  There was a cockroach, scuttling near the sugar bowl.  He watched it.  It was, perhaps, a sign.  But of what?  He didn\\'t know.  Not yet.  The tea grew colder.  The light, dimmer.  He remained.  Waiting.\\n\\nThe verb \"to be,\" she noticed, was losing its hold.  Not all at once, of course.  A slow seepage.  First, it was the articles.  \"A\" and \"the\" –  gone, vanishing like chalk dust on a breeze.  A sentence like, \"The boy is tall,\" became simply, \"Boy tall.\"  A simplification, perhaps?  No.  It felt… shallower.  Emptier.\\n\\nThen the auxiliary verbs.  \"He *was* running\" shifted to \"He running.\"  Past tense, a crucial distinction, lost.  The children, bright-eyed, uncomprehending of her concern, seemed perfectly content.  Their drawings, however, became increasingly abstract.  Less representational.  More… feeling.\\n\\nShe tried a different approach.  A simple question: \"What is that?\" pointing to a bright red apple.  Silence.  Then, a small girl, her brow furrowed in concentration, offered, \"Red.\"  Just \"Red.\"  The noun, stripped bare.  No article, no verb.  Just the adjective, clinging stubbornly to existence.\\n\\nThe lesson on prepositions proved disastrous.  \"On,\" \"in,\" \"under\" –  lost to the ether.  The sentences crumbled.  Meaning evaporated.  She felt a tremor, a small earthquake of understanding, in the pit of her stomach.  They weren\\'t *forgetting* the words, exactly.  They were… shedding them.  Molting.  Leaving behind a primal, almost animalistic communication.  A series of grunts and gestures.\\n\\nShe wrote it in her journal, that night:  \"Language, a fragile skin.\"  And then, looking at her own hand, she wondered:  Was the pen too heavy?  Was the paper too rough?  Did the words themselves, the very act of writing, feel… unnecessary?  A superfluity.  A burden.\\n\\nThe collection:  a jumble.  Stopped hands, shattered crystals, gears strewn like fallen teeth.  Mostly, silence.  The usual tick-tock absence.  He’d catalogued them all, of course.  Number 37:  a banjo clock, missing its pendulum.  Number 82: a cherubic angel, its wings fractured, its face chipped – a lovely ruin.  Number 117:  a mystery.\\n\\nIt began subtly.  A faint *click*.  Not the familiar, metallic *clink* of a loose spring.  This was…different.  More…deliberate.  He’d dismissed it at first.  A settling, perhaps.  The house did settle.  A tremor in the floorboards.\\n\\nThen the *click* repeated, at roughly 15-second intervals.  He checked his own watch.  A digital one, reliable.  The *clicks* coincided with…something.  He couldn\\'t quite place it.  He looked closer at Number 117.  A small, unremarkable thing, a simple brass clock, its face obscured by dust and a crack that bisected the Roman numerals.  \\n\\nHe brushed the dust.  A faint glimmer beneath the crack.  A sliver of the clock face, showing a hand.  Moving.  Imperceptibly, but moving.  \\n\\nHe waited.  The *clicks* continued, almost inaudible.   He felt a strange mixture of unease and…fascination.  The imperfection, the brokenness, the very thing that defined his collection, now defied it.  A functioning clock amongst the defunct.  A silent rebellion.  Or perhaps, a subtle, persistent lie.  He considered adding a note to its catalogue entry: \"Possibly functional.  Further investigation required.\"  Then he thought:  \"Further investigation?  It\\'s just a clock.\"  But then the *click* again, and the doubt returned.\\n\\nThe train arrived.  Always the same train, it seemed.  Or, nearly.  The shade of green, perhaps, a fraction darker this time.  Or was it the light?  The platform, too.  Familiar, yet… the chipped paint on the bench – a new chip, a small, triangular one, by the second leg.  \\n\\nHe knew this city.  He\\'d been here, he calculated, seven times.  Seven times, and each time, a difference.  A difference so slight, so easily overlooked, that it only registered in a kind of peripheral awareness, a flicker at the edge of recognition.  \\n\\nThe hotel room, for instance.  The same room, number 317.  The same faded floral wallpaper, the same oddly positioned lamp.  But the chipped teacup.  Last time, the chip was on the handle.  This time, the rim.  A small, almost imperceptible shift.\\n\\nHe walked the same streets.  The same bakery, the same fountain.  But the pigeons.  Always pigeons, but today, one was… whiter?  Or was it the sun?  The angle of the sun, shifting the perception of the pigeon\\'s feathers.\\n\\nHe ate the same pastry, a croissant.  But the butter.  A different butter, slightly.  A subtle change in texture, a hint of something else – salt?  Or was it only the memory of the previous butter, colouring his experience of this one?\\n\\nEach time, he wrote it down.  Minute details.  A missing tile, a new poster, a different shade of grey in the sky.  A record of inconstant constancy, a city shifting like sand, grain by grain, under the weight of time, or perhaps, under the weight of his own repeated observation.  The city, or the memory of the city, or the act of remembering the city, itself.  Which was it, finally?  He wasn\\'t sure.  He would return, of course.  He always did.\\n\\nThe shoes.  Brown leather.  Not *my* brown leather, exactly.  A shade darker, perhaps. Or was it the light?  I found them at the thrift store, tucked behind a chipped porcelain doll.  Thirty dollars. A bargain, I thought.  For shoes.\\n\\nThey smelled faintly of woodsmoke.  And something else.  Sea salt?  No.  Something *under* the sea salt.  Decay?  No.  Dust, perhaps.  Old dust.  The dust of a forgotten library.\\n\\nThe first walk:  a familiar route, the park.  Nothing unusual.  But later, a persistent scent of cinnamon clung to the leather.  Cinnamon?  I hadn\\'t been near cinnamon.  Had I?  A fleeting memory, a bakery I\\'d passed years ago.  Or was it a dream?\\n\\nThe second walk:  the cobbled street near the river.  Afterwards, a peculiar dampness, the smell of river mud, yes, but also—this is absurd—the faintest trace of almonds.  Almonds?  I bought nothing with almonds that day.  Yet, there it was, a whisper in the leather.\\n\\nThe third walk:  a visit to my mother.  She lives in the suburbs.  The shoes, upon my return, smelled of…her perfume.  Not exactly.  A ghost of it.  A memory of her perfume, perhaps?  Or the perfume of the air *around* her perfume.  A second-hand scent.\\n\\nI stopped wearing them.  The shoes sat in the corner, silent witnesses.  Or perhaps, active participants.  Did they choose me?  Or did I choose them, and become, in some strange way, their vessel?  The question remains.  As does the faint, lingering scent of something…unidentifiable.  Something that smells like a memory.  Of what, I cannot say.\\n\\nHe kept a notebook.  Not for thoughts, exactly.  Or events.  No.  For *near-utterances*.  Phrases that hovered, poised on the tongue, then dissolved.  \\n\\n*“Remarkable, the way the light catches the dust motes…”*  (Unspoken at the museum.  Too precious.  Too much.)\\n\\n*“That’s…a rather…striking…tie.”* (To the man in the aggressively patterned neckwear.  The understatement felt insufficient, the honesty, cruel.)\\n\\n*“I find your…enthusiasm…regarding…ferrets…intriguing.”* (At the ferret convention.  A lie, partly.  Mostly, a failure of engagement.)\\n\\nHe favored the ellipses.  They captured the hesitation, the retreat.  The unsaid.  Sometimes, a single word would suffice:  *“Regret.”*  (After bumping into his ex-wife.  The whole, unspoken sentence, a chasm of regret.)\\n\\nHe considered adding dates.  But the dates would be arbitrary.  The near-utterances existed outside of time, in the liminal space between thought and speech.  A purgatory of almost-words.  A graveyard of what might have been said, but wasn\\'t.  \\n\\nThe notebook grew fat.  He never reread it.  What purpose would it serve?  The near-utterances, once recorded, lost their potency.  They were ghosts, already fading.  And he, their silent chronicler, a collector of ephemera, a connoisseur of the unspoken.  A man who almost spoke.\\n\\nThe postman, a Mr. Finch, noticed it first on Tuesday.  A letter.  In his box.  Addressed to him.  But the handwriting was unfamiliar.  A spidery script, almost illegible.  He opened it.  A single sentence: *The plums are ripening, a slow, purple surrender.*  Odd.  He knew no one who wrote like that, or who, for that matter, mentioned plums.\\n\\nWednesday: another.  This time, typed.  A business-like font, but the content:  *Consider the weight of a single raindrop.  Its impact, negligible, yet.*  Negligible?  What was this?  He checked the return address: none.\\n\\nThursday.  A postcard.  A picture of a particularly uninspired rock formation.  The message, penned in felt-tip:  *The stone remembers, though it does not speak.*  He felt a prickle, a slight unease.  Perhaps a prank? But by whom?  He knew no one given to such cryptic pronouncements.\\n\\nFriday.  A thin, cream-colored envelope.  Inside, a single, perfectly formed, dried leaf.  No words.  Just the leaf.  He stared at it.  A leaf.  From what tree?  He didn\\'t know.  He placed it on his desk, next to the postcard\\'s rock.  Next to the typed sentence about raindrops.  Next to the sentence about plums.\\n\\nThe unsettling thing wasn\\'t the strangeness of the messages, exactly, though they were strange.  It was the regularity.  The expectation.  He found himself checking his mailbox more frequently, a dull ache of anticipation settling in his chest.  The arrival of the unknown missives, a new rhythm in his day.  A rhythm of the unaccountable.  Of the unspoken.  Of the plum, the raindrop, the stone, the leaf.  And what would come next?', 'Diane Williams': 'The chipped porcelain doll stared.  Not at *her*, exactly.  More at the space *beside* her.  Agnes felt this acutely, the space beside her – a chasm yawning in the floral wallpaper.  It had always been there, this space, a silent, unfurnished room in the house of her life.\\n\\nHer husband, Bernard, hummed a tuneless melody while he sharpened his pencils.  The whirring sound, the faint scent of cedar, these were facts.  Agnes knew these facts.  She knew, too, that Bernard loved her.  He said so.  He brought her lilies – white, always white – which she arranged meticulously, their starkness mirroring the emptiness she felt.\\n\\nThis morning, he’d mentioned the robin’s nest in the oak tree.  \"Three little eggs,\" he\\'d said, his voice soft, a sound filtered through that same chasm.  Agnes had nodded.  She’d seen the nest, a messy cup of twigs, but the robins themselves were indistinct blurs.  Like the faces of the women in the magazine spread on the coffee table – faces that spoke of connection, of shared glances and laughter, things Agnes felt like a spectator to, watching through a dusty pane of glass.\\n\\nLater, she walked to the park.  Children shrieked.  A dog barked, its frantic energy a stark contrast to her own stillness.  She saw a woman reading a book, her face illuminated by sunlight.  Agnes wondered if the words on the page were real, or simply another layer of the illusion that surrounded her.\\n\\nShe picked up a smooth grey stone, its cool surface a fleeting sensation against her palm.  She held it tight, the pressure a small rebellion against the vast indifference she felt.  The stone, at least, was a fact.  Solid.  Unmoving.  Like her.\\n\\nReturning home, Bernard was waiting, his pencil poised mid-air.  He smiled, a genuine, loving smile.  And Agnes, looking at him, felt the familiar ache, a dull throb behind her eyes.  The chasm remained.  But the stone, nestled in her pocket, was a small, hard promise.  A promise of something… else.  Something she couldn’t quite name, but something that felt, faintly, like a beginning.  Or perhaps, simply, a different kind of seeing.\\n\\nThe marmalade, he said, was too bitter.  Too *aggressive*, even.  He pushed the tiny, almost comical, pot away.  It sat there, a miniature volcano of orange, unmolested.  I, naturally, found it perfectly acceptable.  Acceptable, even delightful.  Its bitterness, a certain *zing*, reflected, I thought, the very essence of a Tuesday.\\n\\nHe stared at his eggs.  Scrambled, as always.  Perfectly scrambled, I might add.  The whites, a cloud; the yolks, molten suns.  He poked at them with his fork, a small, precise stabbing.  The sound, I swear, was like a tiny, repeated betrayal.  \\n\\n\"The toast,\" he said, finally, his voice a low hum, a subterranean tremor.  \"It\\'s…underdone.\"\\n\\nUnderdone?  I\\'d timed it precisely.  Three minutes, exactly.  The same three minutes, every Tuesday morning, for the past…well, let\\'s not specify the duration.  Some things are better left unquantified.  Like the gradual shifting of tectonic plates.  Or the slow, imperceptible unraveling of a marriage.\\n\\nHe didn’t eat the toast.  Nor the eggs.  He just sat there, a man sculpted from dissatisfaction, his gaze fixed on something beyond the kitchen window, something I couldn’t see, something perhaps only he could see – the approaching chasm, the yawning void.\\n\\nI ate my toast.  The marmalade, I must confess, was quite exquisite.  The bitterness, a welcome counterpoint to the bland predictability of the day.  A hint, perhaps, of what was to come.  Or what had already come, and I\\'d simply failed to notice, until now, this Tuesday morning, amidst the underdone toast and the aggressively bitter marmalade.  The quiet rumble, the silent fracturing, the slow, deliberate dismantling of everything.\\n\\nThe letter arrived on Tuesday, a Tuesday like any other Tuesday except for the letter.  It was in her own handwriting, spidery and familiar, yet utterly foreign.  The paper was thick, cream-colored, the kind she wouldn’t buy, wouldn\\'t even touch.  The address was hers, of course, but the return address was a place she\\'d never been, a place that smelled faintly, in her mind, of brine and regret.\\n\\nThe letter itself was short, alarmingly so.  Just three sentences.  \"The bird is not what it seems.\"  \"The key is under the azalea, but beware the thorns.\"  \"He knows.\"\\n\\nShe didn\\'t remember writing it.  Didn\\'t remember the bird, the azalea, or the *he*.  She looked at her hands, her fingers, searching for a phantom memory, a ghost of ink clinging to her skin.  There was nothing. Only the unsettling certainty that the letter was hers, and that she’d forgotten something terrible.  Something, she felt in the hollow of her chest, that was already beginning to unravel her.\\n\\nHe hated the way she said \"normal.\"  Not the sound exactly, though the slight upturn at the end, a tiny, almost imperceptible question mark, grated.  It wasn\\'t the inflection, precisely. It was the *context*.  Always, the context.  \"Normal\" was her hammer, wielded against the chipped porcelain of their life.  \\n\\nNormal laundry.  Normal dinner.  Normal sex, once a month, on Tuesdays, like clockwork, a normal malfunctioning clock.  He\\'d tried explaining the gears, the rust, the way the pendulum swung not in time but in a hesitant, almost apologetic rhythm, but she just stared, her eyes the color of dishwater, and repeated, \"Normal.\"  \\n\\nHe\\'d bought her a new watch, a Swiss watch, precise, elegant, a tiny whirring marvel.  She\\'d looked at it, at the perfectly aligned hands, and said, \"Normal,\" as if it were a sad, beige cardigan.\\n\\nHe started to avoid Tuesdays.  He\\'d go to the library, surrounded by the quiet rustle of pages, the scent of old paper and possibility, anything but the sterile, normal routine of their bedroom. He’d look at the spines, at the titles, at the weight of knowledge, a weight his wife never seemed to carry.  She only carried \"normal.\"\\n\\nOne day, he found a book on linguistics.  He read about phonemes, morphemes, the subtle shifts in meaning, the way a single word could carry the weight of a lifetime.  He underlined the section on intonation, circled the word \"normal.\"  He looked at the word, at its simplicity, its deceptive ordinariness.  It was a word that could crush a man.  \\n\\nHe looked at his watch. It was Tuesday.  He heard her voice, small, distant, yet somehow deafening, whispering, \"Normal,\" and the sound, this time, felt like a final, dull thud.  He closed the book. The library was quiet.  Too quiet.  Normal.\\n\\nThe girl, Elara, said the cat spoke to her. Not meowed, not purred—spoke.  In words.  Small words, like \"sun,\" and \"sleep,\" and once, \"hungry,\" which was undeniably true, as the cat, a marmalade tabby named Marmalade, was indeed, perpetually hungry.\\n\\nHer mother, a woman whose patience was as thin as the rind of a particularly sad lemon, sighed.  \"Elara,\" she said, her voice the sound of dry leaves skittering across pavement. \"Cats don\\'t talk.\"\\n\\nElara, small and pale, with eyes the color of chipped porcelain, didn\\'t flinch. She just stared at the goldfish, its silent, mechanical swimming a counterpoint to the vibrant, unspoken accusation in her gaze.\\n\\n\"He said the goldfish is plotting,\" Elara announced, finally, her voice a wisp of dandelion fluff.\\n\\nThe goldfish, a bloated, orange thing named Bubbles, continued its monotonous laps.  Marmalade, sprawled on the sunbeam slicing through the kitchen, yawned, a pink, fleshy cavern opening in his face.  He did not, as far as anyone could tell, offer a counter-argument.\\n\\nHer mother went back to peeling potatoes, the rhythmic scrape of the peeler a frantic, repetitive chant.  Elara watched her, her small chin tilted, and then she began to hum.  A low, mournful hum that vibrated in the air, like a tiny, persistent earthquake.\\n\\nLater, her father came home, smelling of sawdust and regret. He ruffled Elara\\'s hair, a gesture as clumsy and unconvincing as a poorly-crafted lie.  \"What\\'s all this humming about, sweetheart?\"\\n\\nElara stopped humming.  She pointed a small, accusing finger at the wall. \"The wall is listening,\" she whispered.  \"It’s writing everything down.\"\\n\\nHer father looked at the wall. A perfectly ordinary wall.  Beige.  Unremarkable.  He looked at his wife, whose face was a landscape of weary resignation.  He looked at Elara, whose eyes held a profound, unsettling stillness.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t know what to say.  He didn\\'t know what to think.  The potatoes, forgotten on the counter, began to sprout tiny, pale tendrils, reaching towards the humming girl, towards the silent goldfish, towards the wall that, perhaps, was indeed listening.  Perhaps, he thought, the lies were far less interesting than the truths.  And perhaps, the truths were far too terrible to bear.\\n\\nThe humming.  It wasn’t a machine, not exactly.  More a low thrum, like a bee trapped in a velvet pillowcase.  It emanated from Number 7.  Agnes.  Agnes who never slept, or so it seemed.  Curtains always drawn, a single, unwavering light.  A faint, citrusy smell, too –  like potpourri that had somehow absorbed the scent of old pennies.\\n\\nI saw her once, at dawn.  Not really *saw* her.  A flash of purple – a sleeve, perhaps? –  as she retreated from the overflowing mailbox.  Mail for someone else, I’m sure.  Agnes never received anything.  Never put anything out.\\n\\nThe humming, though.  That was constant.  A counterpoint to the chirping crickets, the distant sirens, the muted arguments from the duplex across the street.  It pulsed. It vibrated the very marrow of my teacup.\\n\\nOne night, a storm.  Rain lashed against my windowpanes.  The humming stopped.  Silence, so profound it felt like a physical weight.  Then, a single, high-pitched *click*.  Like a bone settling into its socket.  And the humming resumed, louder this time, more insistent.\\n\\nI tried to sleep.  I counted sheep, imaginary sheep made of spun moonlight and anxieties.  Then I saw it.  A flicker.  Through Agnes’s blinds.  Not light, not shadow.  Something… iridescent.  Like a trapped firefly, desperately trying to escape a jar of marmalade.\\n\\nThe next morning, the citrus scent was gone.  Replaced by something else.  Something earthy, almost… metallic.  The humming continued.  But now, it sounded… tired.\\n\\nThe spaniel, Winston, stared. Not a casual stare, mind you. This was a stare of profound, unsettling judgment.  He sat on the worn Persian rug, his liver-colored fur the exact shade of the liver pâté Bernard, her husband, preferred, a fact that suddenly felt deeply symbolic, even ominous.  He\\'d been staring like this for seven minutes, according to the kitchen clock, which itself seemed to tick with a conspiratorial slowness.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t the staring itself that bothered her. Winston stared at pigeons, at dust motes, at the subtle shifts in the afternoon light.  This was different. This stare held the weight of undisclosed knowledge, a secret pressed against her like a damp, woolen scarf.\\n\\nIt began last Tuesday.  Bernard had come home smelling faintly of lilies and something else, something sharp and metallic, like the inside of a newly sharpened pencil.  He\\'d claimed a late meeting, but his tie was askew, his usually impeccable hair slightly mussed, and there was a tiny scratch on his cheekbone, barely visible unless the light hit it just so.  The lilies, a generous bouquet, felt…off.  Too showy, too apologetic.\\n\\nWinston, however, had noticed.  He\\'d sniffed at Bernard\\'s trousers, a low growl rumbling in his chest, a sound that vibrated more in her bones than her ears.\\n\\nSince then, the staring had intensified.  He\\'d follow Bernard around the house, a silent shadow, his tail tucked low, his gaze unwavering.  He’d even started leaving tiny, meticulously arranged piles of his own excrement – not in the usual spots, mind you, but in strategic locations: by the antique grandfather clock, near Bernard\\'s favorite armchair, once, inexplicably, inside a perfectly good shoe.\\n\\nThis afternoon, Winston’s stare was directed at the framed photograph on the mantelpiece – Bernard and her, younger, happier, on a beach in Maine.  Bernard’s arm is around her, but his smile didn’t quite reach his eyes.  She’d always attributed it to the photographer’s awkward angle.  Now, she wasn’t so sure.\\n\\nThe silence stretched, thick and suffocating.  Then, a single bark, sharp and insistent, punctuated the stillness.  It wasn’t a playful bark, or a bark of alarm.  It was a bark that said, *I know something you don\\'t know,* a bark that echoed the metallic tang she’d smelled on Bernard’s clothes.\\n\\nShe stood, a sudden tremor running through her.  She picked up a small, chipped teacup from the sideboard, the one Bernard had broken last month, claiming he’d tripped over Winston.  The lie, now, felt as sharp and metallic as that unfamiliar scent.\\n\\nShe looked at Winston, who returned her gaze with an unsettling calm.  He didn’t blink.  He simply stared, his expression a blend of knowing and… pity?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps it was simply the unwavering judgment of a spaniel who had witnessed too much.  She wasn’t sure which was worse.  The uncertainty itself felt like a betrayal.  A betrayal, perhaps, Winston was trying to tell her about.\\n\\nThe cake was marzipan, a cruel, sugary skull.  Not a happy birthday skull, mind you, but a skull that knew things. It sat on a lace doily, the lace as stiff as a shroud.  I remember the closet, too, a dark maw in the hall, its door ajar, revealing only the faintest suggestion of something—a sleeve, perhaps, or a wisp of lavender.  But the phone? That’s the knife twist.\\n\\nThe phone rang.  Three rings.  A precise, almost mathematical three rings.  Then silence.  I was eight.  Or was I eleven?  The age shifts, like the marzipan crumbling under the weight of a forgotten sorrow.  The caller ID, if there had been such a thing, would have shown a single digit:  a 7.  Seven.  Seven what?  Seven years of bad luck? Seven missed chances?  Seven…layers in that infernal cake?\\n\\nI didn’t answer.  Couldn’t.  The marzipan skull seemed to watch me, its sugary eyes burning into my soul.  The closet breathed.  Or maybe it was just the house settling, a sigh of old wood and dust.  But the phone call, that three-ring phantom, that’s the part that hurts the most.  It’s too sharp, too clean, too perfectly formed to be real.  Like a memory surgically implanted, leaving a scar that never fades.  And the cake?  I never tasted it.  Never even touched it.  It just sat there, a morbid centerpiece, in a room that never existed. Or did it?\\n\\nAgnes, or was it Beatrice?  Agnes, no, definitely Beatrice,  sat across from him, a man whose name she’d misplaced somewhere between the chipped porcelain of her teacup and the faint scent of lilies, lilies she was certain he’d brought, though perhaps it was carnations, or was it her own lilies, the ones wilting sadly in a vase that resembled a lopsided bird?  \\n\\n“Bartholomew,” she ventured, a tentative offering into the silence that hummed with unspoken resentments and forgotten birthdays.  \\n\\nHe chuckled, a dry, rustling sound like autumn leaves skittering across pavement. “Agnes?  Is it Agnes?  Or is it…  Penelope?” He tapped a long, elegant finger against a menu, ignoring the tremor in his hand.  The menu was for a restaurant they weren’t in.\\n\\n“Penelope?” Beatrice, or was it Agnes, felt a familiar pang of something – annoyance?  Affection? –  it was hard to tell, the emotions all muddled like a poorly mixed cocktail.  “My sister, perhaps.  She’s… difficult.”\\n\\nHe nodded, his gaze drifting to the wall, a wall that wasn’t there. “Difficult,” he echoed, his voice a low murmur. “Like remembering names.  It’s…  a curse, isn’t it?  Reminds one of…  of…  what was it again?”\\n\\nShe stared at him, a nameless anxiety blooming in her chest.  He was so close, yet so impossibly distant, like a reflection shimmering in a heat-hazed mirror.  His eyes, the color of faded denim, held a glint of something she couldn\\'t quite grasp.  Regret?  Longing?  Or was it simply the overwhelming urge to flee before the next misplaced name shattered what little remained of their…  what was it they had?  A conversation? A memory? A shared delusion?\\n\\nHe cleared his throat.  “I believe,” he said, leaning forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, “that your name is…  Deborah.”\\n\\nBeatrice, or was it Agnes, or maybe even Penelope, sighed.  The lilies, or carnations, or whatever they were, wilted a little more.  The lopsided bird vase seemed to tilt further.  And the restaurant, the one they weren’t in, vanished altogether.\\n\\nDr. Albright adjusted his glasses, the rims pinching the bridge of his nose like a tiny, judgmental pair of pliers.  “So, the rash,” he said, his voice the texture of slightly stale crackers.  “It itches, yes?”\\n\\nI nodded. It itched. A relentless, maddening itch that had begun subtly, a whisper against my skin, but now roared like a tiny, furious beast trapped beneath my epidermis.\\n\\n“And the fatigue?”\\n\\nThe fatigue.  Ah, the fatigue.  It was less a feeling and more a state of being, a fundamental lack of… something.  Energy?  Purpose?  The very fabric of my existence seemed to be fraying at the edges, unraveling like a cheap, poorly-dyed sweater.  “Yes,” I whispered, the word tasting of ash.\\n\\nDr. Albright tapped a pen against his clipboard, the sound echoing the hollow emptiness inside me.  He didn’t look at me.  He never really looked at me, only at the clipboard, as if my body were merely a vessel containing a series of symptoms, a collection of data points to be charted and categorized.\\n\\n“Cortisone cream,” he declared, his voice flat, devoid of warmth or concern.  “And rest.  Plenty of rest.”\\n\\nRest. The word hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.  Rest?  What was the point of rest if the very act of existing felt like a Sisyphean struggle against the inevitable tide of nothingness?  Was rest even possible when the fundamental architecture of my being felt so fundamentally… flawed?\\n\\nA sudden, inexplicable urge to confess overwhelmed me.  I blurted it out, a desperate, choked confession:  \"Doctor, I think… I think I might be unraveling.  Not just the rash, but… everything.”\\n\\nDr. Albright didn\\'t flinch.  He simply reached for a fresh prescription pad, his movements precise, almost robotic.  He didn’t look up.  \"Anxiety,\" he diagnosed, his voice the sound of a distant train whistle fading into the grey expanse of an indifferent universe. \"Common.  Very common.\"\\n\\nHe handed me the prescription.  As I left, I noticed a small, almost imperceptible tremor in his hand.  A tiny, almost imperceptible crack in the facade of his clinical detachment.  Was it empathy?  Or simply the tremor of a man confronting the same terrifying, inescapable truth: that we are all, ultimately, just a collection of symptoms waiting to be diagnosed, categorized, and ultimately, forgotten?  The itch remained.  But now, it was accompanied by something far worse: the unshakeable certainty of my own impending insignificance.  And the cortisone cream?  It did nothing. Absolutely nothing.'}\n"

We are pleased but cannot understand why they do not come into our kitchen where we have traps set, as they come into the kitchens of our neighbors. Although we are pleased, we are also upset, because the mice behave as though there were something wrong with our kitchen. What makes this even more puzzling is that our house is much less tidy than the houses of our neighbors. There is more food lying about in our kitchen, more crumbs on the counters and filthy scraps of onion kicked against the base of the cabinets. In fact, there is so much loose food in the kitchen I can only think the mice themselves are defeated by it. In a tidy kitchen, it is a challenge for them to find enough food night after night to survive until spring. They patiently hunt and nibble hour after hour until they are satisfied. In our kitchen, however, they are faced with something so out of proportion to their experience that they cannot deal with it. They might venture out a few steps, but soon the overwhelming sights and smells drive them back into their holes, uncomfortable and embarrassed at not being able to scavenge as they should.\",\n",

Although we have not met him, we know he will be bald, incontinent, speechless, and nearly completely unable to help himself. We don't know exactly how long he will stay, relying entirely on us for food, clothing, and shelter.Our situation reminds me that a leathery-skinned old Indian gentleman once spent several months with my sister in London. At first he slept in a tent in her back yard. Then he moved into the house. Here he made it his project to rearrange the many books in the house, which were in no particular order. He decided upon categories—mystery, history, fiction—and surrounded himself with clouds of smoke from his cigarettes as he worked. He explained his system in correct but halting English to anyone who came into the room. Several years later he died suddenly and painfully in a London hospital. For religious reasons, he had refused all treatment.This Indian visitor of my sister's also reminds me of another old man—the very old father of a friend of mine. He had once been a professor of economics. He was old and deaf even when my friend was a child. Later he could not contain his urine, laughed wildly and soundlessly during his daughter's wedding, and when asked to say a few words rose trembling and spoke about Communism. This man is now in a nursing home. My friend says he is smaller every year.Like my friend's father, our visitor will have to be bathed by us, and will not use the toilet. We have appointed a small, sunny room for him next to ours, where we will be able to hear him if he needs help during the night. Someday, he may repay us for all the trouble we will go to, but we don't really expect it. Although we have not yet met him, he is one of the few people in the world for whom we would willingly sacrifice almost anything.\",\n",

    "\"A certain woman had a very sharp consciousness but almost no memory. She remembered enough to get by from day to day. She remembered enough to work, and she worked hard. She did good work, and was paid for it, and earned enough to get by, but she did not remember her work, so that she could not answer questions about it when people asked, as they did ask, since the work she did was interesting.She remembered enough to get by, and to do her work, but she did not learn from what she did, or heard, or read. For she did read, she loved to read, and she took good notes on what she read, on the ideas that came to her from what she read, since she did have some ideas of her own, and even on her ideas about these ideas. Some of her ideas were even very good ideas, since she had a very sharp consciousness. And so she kept good notebooks and added to them year by year, and because many years passed this way, she had a long shelf of these notebooks, in which her handwriting became smaller and smaller.Sometimes, when she was tired of reading a book, or when she was moved by a sudden curiosity she did not altogether understand, she would take an earlier notebook from the shelf and read a little of it, and she would be interested in what she read. She would be interested in the notes she had once taken on a book she was reading or on her own ideas. It would seem all new to her, and indeed most of it would be new to her. Sometimes she would only read and think, and sometimes she would make a note in her current notebook of what she was reading in a notebook from an earlier time, or she would make a note of an idea that came to her from what she was reading. Other times she would want to make a note but choose not to, since she did not think it quite right to make a note of what was already a note, though she did not fully understand what was not right about it. She wanted to make a note of a note she was reading, because this was her way of understanding what she read, though she was not assimilating what she read into her mind, or not for long, but only into another notebook. Or she wanted to make a note because to make a note was her way of thinking this thought.Although most of what she read was new to her, sometimes she immediately recognized what she read and had no doubt that she herself had written it, and thought it. It seemed perfectly familiar to her, as though she had just thought it that very day, though in fact she had not thought it for some years, unless reading it again was the same as thinking it again, or the same as thinking it for the first time, and though she might never have thought it again, if she had not happened to read it in her notebook. And so she knew by this that these notebooks truly had a great deal to do with her, though it was hard for her to understand, and troubled her to try to understand, just how they had to do with her, how much they were of her and how much they were outside her and not of her, as they sat there on the shelf, being what she knew but did not know, being what she had read but did not remember reading, being what she had thought but did not now think, or remember thinking, or if she remembered, then did not know whether she was thinking it now or whether she had only once thought it, or understand why she had had a thought once and then years later the same thought, or a thought once and then never that same thought again.\",\n",

I am envious of one couple we know, for example, who both love Handel so much they will sometimes fly all the way to Texas just to hear a particular tenor sing a part in one of his operas. By now, they have also converted another friend of ours into a lover of Handel. I am surprised, because the last time she and I talked about music, what she loved was Hank Williams. All three of them went by train to Washington, D.C., this year to hear Giulio Cesare in Egitto. I prefer the composers of the nineteenth century and particularly Dvořák. But I'm pretty open to all sorts of music, and usually if I'm exposed to something long enough, I come to like it. But even though my husband puts on some sort of Handel vocal music almost every night if I don't say anything to stop him, I have not come to love Handel.

By this time I had not yet apologized for my actions. Last night my husband told me to get up out of the bed and to go into another room. My husband’s a kind man, a clever man, a patient man, an honest man, a hard-working man. Many people have the notion we live in an age where more people who behave just like he does lurk.

    "    \"Someone glorious had built this temple or call it a house that we had bought tickets to swing through. Nevertheless, one of the first things I like to do is to take stock of the gift shop, an enduring practice. It seems entirely natural to go to the gift shop first, because it eases the necessary transition into the spectacular. I examined a platter depicting a humorous and lively fish and a terra cotta pot. I was scorning so much else. You know, terra cotta is very widespread. It is used by every civilization. I selected note cards that feature images of women bearing up. These are caryatids. One of these women is particularly sensual in her pose, yet her expression is modest. Another’s face is decidedly masculine. Her chin projects nearly as far forward as her nose and she stares aggressively ahead. Yet most are downcast, not revealing trapped sexual energy, not revealing energy. My own head started aching and shortly we joined up with a guide who told us that dinner on these premises was followed by a formal dance held in the drawing room. Music was furnished by an orchestra from New York City. The centerpiece on the dining table might have been a yachting trophy and there were once sixty servants on the estate! Dominic said, “This is funny.” And I said, “Why?” Our safety, we were told, was the primary concern and we were told to be careful going up and down the stairs and that we should regard ourselves as if we personally lived here. Everything is aristocratic and stylish and I could barely recall our hasty morning departure from Little Neck—from bitterness, political stresses, and from our immoral conduct. That was all blurred and misshapen. However, this Vanderbilt mansion, I recall it well. When it was built it cost $660,000 dollars. Guests included nobility and an American president. And Louise Vanderbilt’s bedroom carpet weighs over 2,300 pounds! We heard that she was particularly contented when she helped people in the community!—if there was illness, if there was poverty! I saw a photographic portrait of her in which she appeared with her waist fashionably corseted painfully, no forced smile, jewelry on, a plumed fan in her hand, seemingly for my benefit, because I admire the fan so much. I can imagine the fan bringing my life freshly to life as she points the fan all fluffy and blooming forward toward me—as if there are only clouds and space all around us and a blue ceiling. I also have a fan, a hand-painted, Chinese fan made of paper and bamboo that shows off a mountain region landscape that includes a modern dam installation. I don’t use the fan nearly enough in summertime when I need it. The relic has been in the dark and unremembered. I don’t use it. I never used it. Nobody ever used it. I wouldn’t think of using it. I bought it. I just found it. I went looking for it. When I close the fan, the fan sounds like an oaf who is burping or she is slurping soup, but when I open the fan!—I hear genteel and soft mechanical ticking.\",\n",

She told me what she serves for meals. “It’s all going to all work out,” my husband said. “She will love you as much as she loves me.” His mother had a way of being strong, but not nasty. It was so sensuous. She and I both are short, short-haired women without eyeglasses. My husband has big eyes and he is large and muscular. I am very shy. His mother put her arm plus her leg around me—just live with it for a while. I, myself, how gladly I do. Before long legend has it that when a partnership works, it is no accident. More accurately, more importantly, this illustrates this: I learn more about the arts and skills.\",\n",

I saw Mr. Haddock at the bay perhaps picking up his spirits. It’s peaceful at the bay and Haddock says he does not have an ailment. He has no eye problems and perfect ears. You know—fluid-filled space!—a bay, the bay! Fancy cushion clouds at the bay are the same shapes and sizes as I saw when I had an exact understanding of conditions greater than my emotions. Mr. Haddock’s laugh—yeah, it is similar, but that’s not what it sounds like. I remembered what it sounds like—then when you did that—I forgot. There are a lot of young, forgetful people going around these days. At least, I am young and pretty and can make my claims. Fifteen years ago there was a cloud I saw which moved around, traveled, came by, fled into the woods, exerted a strong influence, spent more than half an hour there, was free to roam, before returning to the village, where the cloud added up to a source of pride.\",\n",

    "    \"That’s how bright the sky was! A woman’s lilac dress somehow picked up greenish hues as she was chewing and chewing one biteful. And was she even hungry as she squeezed her hands together under her chin, so that her knuckles pulsed?—as she kept on with her snapping and gouging and delving into what was both pliable and crisp. It was not easily done—and then a boy who was with her sneezed. “God bless you!” I said. “Why?” the boy asked. Another one of his sneezes followed that expanded and rolled but drew no salute. The chewer had stopped her chewing and thanked the server for offering her more coffee—coffee that I could see had strength, unexpected darkness. And with a deep, indwelling smile, the server said, “Perfect.” Then I coughed abruptly and the cough was a bugle-like three-parter. There followed some barely audible drumming on a tabletop from a man who was enthusiastically engaged with the syncopations. The woman told her boy, “Well then, I want you—” as the boy cowered and as the sound of my own tearing, with my teeth, into my toast, interfered with my hearing any more of his mother’s scolding. It is such a challenge to express exuberances in disrupted areas. I folded my restaurant tab in half, tore it at the center of the fold. I held it like a cigarette, then I rolled the two ends over my fingers and put my mouth to it and I blew. This didn’t work. I was out of practice, but it needs to be flimsy paper, because then when the air strikes across the torn slot, the paper starts to vibrate in the airstream and it makes a big noise. There! Then I did it! It’s not always one hundred percent.\",\n",

    "    \"There is a part of the sky at nightfall that she really enjoys, too, and the woman’s late father can be seen never suffering from the waist up, hanging young and bland above a sideboard in a portrait. Just the same, this woman is bollixed by an emotional problem and it’s as if she smacks her head against the wall until blood spurts out and the color red is also vivid in the street where she lives—where an equestrian statue has been painted a pretty shade of it by vandals. You see the woman’s health began to give way because of that emotional problem. It doesn’t help that she eats heavily salted, dyed meat along with her eggs and irresponsible is not the right word for this. The place in which she sleeps poorly is in the room across the passage from where she eats and we have the ability to get close to her gross movements, her ordinary life and to pick at her critically. During lonely months the woman thought, I touched him! And we often observe this type of pining among primitive types. I saw her grieving, but I didn’t think the world of her. Where is her capacity for being a sly tease? For being playful? Mind you, the portrait of her father features good flesh-painting and the technique was drawn from the methods of others—feathery touches. What if the woman is dignified when she speaks?—and what if I am generous about her behind her back by suggesting that her structure—her long back muscles, her buttocks, shoulder blades, all of it—amount to a great domestic landmark?—gracious and picturesque—that may stand up against a headwind while she overlooks the broad expanse of a river. She’ll love me for it. Will do.\",\n",

    "    \"Each child had a claim to a pile of jewelry when my paternal grandmother died—and how did they determine who was to have which pile? The heirs were sent into an adjacent room and a trustee called out loudly enough to be heard by all of them—\\\"Who will have this pile?\\\" My father said he shouted—\\\"August Wilhelm will have this pile!\\\" Thus, my mother eventually received two gem-set rings that she wore as a pair until she achieved an advanced age and then she amalgamated the two of them into one—so that the diamonds and the sapphires were impressively bulked together. I had to have it. It was a phantasmagoria. I selected it after my mother’s death, not because I liked it but because it offers the memory of my mother and of the awkward, temporarily placed cold comfort that she gave me. It’s hard to believe that our affair was so long ago.\",\n",

Nevertheless, I had a smeary view of a child in the whirlwind who was walking backward. He was carrying his jacket instead of wearing it. And he kicked up his feet with such aptitude. In a luncheonette that I took cover in, I overheard “Yes, I do mind…”—this while I was raising and rearranging memories of many people’s personal details, tryst locales, endearments—faces, genitalia, like Jimmy T’s, or Lee’s, which I pine for. This is regular work with regular work hours that I do. Through the window pane of the coffee shop, I could see clearly into a hair salon across the street, where two men—both with hairbrushes and small, hand-held dryers—together—down-stroked the mane of a cloaked woman. The men were performing feats of legerdemain. Streamers sprang up around her head, as if snakes or dragons were busy eating their own tails. And then, weighing down her shoulders, there was the golden hoard—for future use—of bullshit.\",\n",

    "    \"The creature had come absurdly close to our window. It had lifted its chin—face—specifically toward mine while we were at breakfast in the country. I’d say the animal looked and looked at me and looked, ardently. I was reminded how to fall in love by meeting its eyes and by how long the rendezvous lasted—until doomsday, say. I am unhappily married. Today I was dressed up in red-fox orange—orangutan orange—apricot orange, candlelight orange. I had on a wool plaid coat and had been racketing around my city precinct doing errands. Returning home, while in the elevator of our building, facing the closed door, I combed nearly every hair—all that thinning hair—along the sides of my skull. That massive man that I didn’t know at all, who had a stiffness of manner at the back of the elevator, he acknowledged me. And the doorman Bill had not averted his eyes. No, not the sort of thing that I usually report. No, that I had withdrawn the tortoiseshell comb from my purse to do the smoothing with and then re-stowed it on the way to 3A, our apartment. The comb I keep in the quilted sack, where I also conceal a tiny toothpaste, the easy-to-carry traveler’s toothbrush, and my eyeglass-lens polishing cloth. The carpet was unmarked by dirt, but one important thing in our foyer was missing—the color with the green leaves in a vase. The old floor gets better with age, but boy it needed to be cleaned up—then it will shine. I also have affectionate and friendly wishes for the brass, crystal, silver dishes, vases, and pitchers. My conversation with my husband was as follows: “Are you all right? What do you want? You’re looking at me.” In the park I had wanted to talk today to a bird who wasn’t interested in talking to me. Lust and temptation are sometimes personified. I heard the bird cry— Chew! Chew! I took pains to say Chew! Chew!—loudly, too.\",\n",

Then a wristwatch, its crystal cracked like a spiderweb, purchased for a pittance at a flea market.  Soon, shelves overflowed.  Broken time, meticulously catalogued.

      "The cake.  Lemon.  Not quite lemon, more like the ghost of lemon, a pale imitation clinging to the spongy air itself.  It sat on the chipped Formica, a stark white against the grain, a monument to something unfinished.  I remember it vividly, the way the frosting, a brittle, almost skeletal layer, cracked under the slightest pressure. Pressure.  He’d said he’d call.\n",

      "The closet.  Not my closet.  Hers.  A suffocating space crammed with the forgotten things of a life I only half-understood.  Dresses, stiff and lifeless, hung like desiccated birds. The air, thick with mothballs and regret.  I pressed my ear to the door, listening for the phone, a phantom ring echoing in the hollow of my chest.\n",

      "The phone.  It didn’t ring.  Never did.  But the silence, that was the loudest sound.  A silence that vibrated, a physical thing, pressing down on me, shaping me, like the weight of those forgotten dresses, the weight of that unreal cake.  Its sharpness, its impossible detail – the way the sunlight, slanted and cruel, caught the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the cracks in the frosting, the cracks in everything.  Was it real?  The cake, the closet, the silence?  Or just a memory, too bright, too sharp, to possibly be true?  A phantom lemon, a ghost of a call.  And me, forever pressing my ear to the wrong door.\n",

She was telling me about her brother, Bartholomew, or possibly Bartholomew’s wife.  He’d invented a device—a whatsit—for measuring the precise droop of a wilting daisy.  Or was it a rose?  The details blurred like a watercolor left in the rain.\n",

      "“It’s quite ingenious, really,” she said, her voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement.  Or was it gravel?  I couldn’t quite recall.

      "1. The compass was not gold, as one might expect.  Brass, perhaps.  Or a dull, tarnished silver.  I cannot recall.  What I remember is the weight of it in my palm, unexpectedly heavy.  Heavier than it should have been for its size.  Found it wedged in a crevice of the mast, half-buried in dried seaweed.  Seaweed, the colour of old pennies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The needle spun.  Not a gentle spin, but a frantic, almost violent gyration.  It did not point north.  Nor south.  Nor any direction I recognized.  It seemed to choose its direction at random, then abruptly change its mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried to ignore it.  Sailors have superstitions.  Best not to invite trouble.  But the weight of it, in my pocket, was a constant reminder.  A small, insistent pressure against my thigh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, during the storm, the compass settled.  Pointed directly down.  Towards the hold.  Towards the bilge.  Towards, I realized with a sudden, unpleasant chill, the heart of the ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Dewey Decimal system, she thought, a marvel of human order, yet—  a book, misplaced. Not lost, exactly.  It was *there*, on the shelf,  but…different.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yesterday, it was *The History of Bees*. Today, *Recipes for a Revolution*.  \n",
      "\n",
      "She checked the catalogue. No record of a change.  A phantom book?  No, it had a call number, a spine, pages.  But the pages…  always different. Always legible. Always bound.\n",
      "\n",
      "She considered the possibilities.  A prank?  Highly unlikely. The library was quiet.  Mostly.  Mostly people who valued the quiet.  The hushed reverence of the stacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "She took it home.  Read *Recipes for a Revolution*—or what she thought was *Recipes for a Revolution*. It contained, unexpectedly, a recipe for marmalade, followed by a treatise on the socio-economic implications of the French Revolution.  A curious pairing.\n",
      "\n",
      "That night, she awoke to the faintest scratching.  A whisper of paper.  She went to the book, placed on her nightstand.  *The History of Bees* again.  But not the same *History of Bees* as before.  This one included footnotes, extensive footnotes, on the mating rituals of the honey badger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The librarian, a woman who preferred the company of books to people, found herself strangely captivated.  This book, this…entity…was a puzzle.  A nightly metamorphosis.  A testament to, perhaps, the instability of knowledge itself.  Or, perhaps, simply, a very clever—and very persistent—student.  She considered leaving a note.  A note with a recipe.  For marmalade.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The first letter arrived on a Tuesday.  Not a particularly noteworthy Tuesday.  Rain, mostly.  The postman, a new one, I think,  left it on the mat with a thud that seemed disproportionate to its thinness.  Addressed to Miss Elara Vance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Elara Vance did not live here.  I know this.  I am the only resident.  My name is not Elara Vance.  It is, in fact, quite different.  But the letter, a pale, almost translucent envelope, was clearly meant for this address, the numbers precise, the street name undeniably mine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I opened it, naturally. Curiosity, a small, persistent insect. Inside, a single sentence:  *The pear tree blooms late this year.*\n",
      "\n",
      "The second letter arrived a week later.  This one was thicker, suggesting a more substantial—though still, I suspected, brief—content.  Again, to Miss Elara Vance.  This time, the sentence was longer: *The pear tree blooms late this year, and the scent is faint, almost imperceptible.*\n",
      "\n",
      "A third followed. Then a fourth.  Each a single sentence, each concerning the pear tree.  Its blossoms, its fruit, its eventual shedding of leaves.  The sentences grew increasingly melancholic, mirroring, I thought, the slow decay of autumn.\n",
      "\n",
      "I considered returning them.  But to whom?  There was no return address.  And even if there were, what would I say?  *This letter is addressed to someone who does not live here*?  It seemed inadequate.  The sentences, though about a pear tree, felt more like a message, a coded communication addressed not to a person, but to a place.  To this house, perhaps.  To me, perhaps, via a ghost of a resident.  Or a ghost of a sentence.  The rain continued.  The pear tree, I noticed, did indeed bloom late that year.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The café was emptying.  A single, stubborn chair remained occupied.  He, naturally.  He hadn't said much, really.  Just sipped his lukewarm coffee, a faint tremor in his hand.  The waitress, young, efficient, had asked twice.  Once politely.  Once less so.  He'd only looked at her, a strange, fixed gaze.  Not unkind, not exactly defiant.  More…calculating.  As if measuring the angle of the late afternoon sun against the precise grain of the Formica tabletop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time, you see.  It was a matter of time.  Not the time on the clock, which, admittedly, was pointing towards closing.  But a different time.  An inner time.  A time only *he* could perceive.  The right time.  He hadn't specified what this \"right time\" entailed.  Leaving?  Perhaps.  Or perhaps something else entirely.  Something to do with the chipped teacup, perhaps, or the way the dust motes danced in the fading light.  One couldn't rush such things.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitress sighed, a sound as thin and brittle as a dropped sugar cube.  She switched off the lights, leaving him in a pool of amber. He remained.  Unmoved.  His coffee, now cold.  The right time, it seemed, was still some distance off.  Or perhaps, it had already passed.  He couldn't quite decide.  The ambiguity, after all, was part of the equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The verb *to be*—was it *being* forgotten?  I noticed it first in Elias.  His sentences, once neatly if sparsely constructed, now lacked the scaffolding of auxiliary verbs.  \"Happy,\" he'd say, instead of \"I am happy.\"  Or, \"Book good.\"  A simplification, a shedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, Clara.  She omitted articles.  \"Dog chased cat.\"  Not *a* dog, not *the* cat.  The specifics, the careful delineations, were dissolving.  Like sugar in water, I thought, though I hadn't used that simile in years.  The simile itself—was it fading, too?\n",
      "\n",
      "I marked their papers, the absences more striking than the presence of words.  A noun here, a verb there, stranded like ships in a fog.  Their grasp of tenses—gone.  Past, present, future—all collapsing into a single, undifferentiated now.  Their understanding of pronouns—a mystery.  *He*, *she*, *it*—lost in the murk of meaninglessness.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the parent-teacher conference, Mrs. Petrova, Elias's mother, simply nodded.  \"He speaks less,\" she said.  She didn't say *less what*.  Perhaps she, too, was forgetting.  The words themselves seemed to be shrinking, receding like the tide.  The tide—was that the right word?  Or was it something else, something I couldn't quite remember?\n",
      "\n",
      "The silence in the classroom was not a quiet, but an absence.  A void where words should have been.  I tried to correct them, but the corrections seemed… futile.  Pointless.  Empty.  Like the space between words, a space that was growing, expanding, swallowing everything whole.  Even my own thoughts.  Even my own…  *language*.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The collection, of course, began innocently enough.  A discarded mantel clock, its pendulum stubbornly still, found discarded in an alley.  Then a wristwatch, its crystal cracked like a spiderweb, purchased for a pittance at a flea market.  Soon, shelves overflowed.  Broken time, meticulously catalogued.  Each imperfection noted:  a chipped enamel face, a rusted gear, a shattered glass.  A taxonomy of arrested moments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, *it* began.  Subtle, at first.  A faint tick, perhaps imagined.  Number 73, a small, brass carriage clock, its hands frozen at 2:17.  Or was it?  A day later, 2:18.  Then 2:19.  The others remained resolutely still, their internal mechanisms as silent as tombs.  But 73…73 was progressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The others mocked it, I thought.  Their stillness a silent judgment.  A chorus of brokenness.  I checked my own watch, the one that *worked*, the one I refused to let become part of the collection.  It agreed with 73.  But could I trust it?  Could I trust anything anymore?  After all, I had devoted my life to the study of the *untrustworthy*.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discrepancy – a mere minute, then an hour – was insignificant.  Yet, it felt… monumental.  A betrayal.  A single working clock amongst the dead.  A solitary, ticking heresy.  I considered dismantling it, reducing it to the silent state of its brethren.  But the thought, somehow, felt wrong.  Like silencing a witness.  A witness to what, though?  To the passage of time itself?  Or merely to my own, obsessive, cataloguing of its absence?\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The station.  Always the station.  Same beige tile, chipped in the same places, though the chipped places seemed…shifted.  A millimeter, perhaps.  Or was it the light?  The light, always different.  This time, a harder light, less forgiving.  Showed the dust motes more clearly.  More dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel.  Familiar.  The faint smell of disinfectant, the same slightly off-kilter picture above the bed—a landscape, I think.  Mountains?  Or clouds?  It’s hard to tell.  This time, a smudge on the picture.  A new smudge.  Or was it there before?\n",
      "\n",
      "The cafe.  The same chipped cup.  The same woman with the same impossible hat.  But her gaze…a flicker of recognition? Or simply the way the light caught her glasses.  The croissant, though.  Different.  Slightly smaller.  Or was it my imagination?\n",
      "\n",
      "Each visit, a subtraction.  A detail erased.  A colour faded.  A sound muted.  Or was it an addition?  A new crack in the pavement.  A new word scrawled on a wall.  A new shade of grey in the sky.  The city, like a photograph left out in the sun, slowly, imperceptibly, changing.  Disintegrating.  Or evolving?  \n",
      "\n",
      "The question remains:  Am I changing?  Or is it only the city?  And does it matter?  The station awaits.  The same beige tile, the same chipped places…slightly…different.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The shoes.  Brown leather, slightly scuffed at the heel, the kind one might find at a charity shop.  I bought them on impulse, the price a mere trifle.  But then, the oddness began.\n",
      "\n",
      "A faint smell of salt lingered, though I hadn't been near the sea in months.  A trace of damp earth clung to the insoles –  unaccountable, given the dry weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, a tiny sprig of lavender, impossibly lodged in the stitching near the toe.  I'd walked past a lavender bush, yes, but days ago, a different street entirely.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The shoes seemed to remember.  Not consciously, of course.  More a subtle, persistent echo.  A whisper of places visited, things touched. The faintest ghost of a scent, a grain of sand, a forgotten flower.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was unsettling, yet strangely comforting.  A silent chronicle of my movements, my small, unregarded life, preserved in the pores of the leather.  A miniature, ambulatory memory.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One could, I suppose,  become quite attached to such a thing. Or perhaps, one should be wary.  The shoes, after all, knew things.  Things I might prefer to forget.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. The almost-said.  A category, one might say.  Not quite silence, not quite speech.  A hovering.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept a notebook.  Small.  Leather.  The kind that fits in a pocket, though he rarely took it out in public.  Too conspicuous, perhaps.  The act of writing itself, a small betrayal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Entry:  \"The soup is… adequate.\"  (What he *meant* to say:  \"This soup tastes like sadness and lukewarm regret.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Entry:  \"Yes, a lovely evening.\" (The unspoken: \"Though I’d rather be alone, staring into the void of my own increasingly shallow existence.\")\n",
      "\n",
      "He circled the \"lovely\" in the second entry.  A small, almost imperceptible tightening of the pen’s grip.  The pressure of the almost-said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, he almost said, \"I love you.\"  This entry filled a whole page.  A single sentence, meticulously underlined, then crossed out, then underlined again, a frantic dance of the pen.  The paper itself seemed to shudder under the weight of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He considered the nature of these near-utterances.  The difference between the expressed and the unexpressed.  The weight of the unspoken.  He found it fascinating.  Troubling.  Mostly, troubling.\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped keeping the notebook.  The almost-said, it turned out, was quite enough.  The unspoken, a constant hum, a low thrumming that vibrated in his chest.  He had become, in a way, a living notebook.  A repository of the unsaid, the nearly-said, the things he would never say.  And that, he decided, was adequate.  Perfectly adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The postman, a Mr. Finch, I believe his name was, or perhaps it wasn't, began receiving letters.  Not at the post office, of course, but at his own door.  This was unusual.  His own mail, he knew that.  But these—these were different.  The handwriting was unfamiliar.  The stamps, foreign.  The paper, thin, almost translucent in places.\n",
      "\n",
      "One bore a single word:  *Veridian*. Another, a series of numbers: 7, 11, 13, 17.  A third contained only a pressed, dried flower, its petals brittle and brown.  He tried to make sense of it.  He sorted his usual mail, the bills, the circulars, the occasional postcard from a niece he barely knew.  These letters, though, remained stubbornly enigmatic.\n",
      "\n",
      "He considered, briefly, the possibility of a mistake.  The post office, after all, was not without its flaws.  But the addresses were correct, his address, perfectly legible.  He even checked the return address on one, a smudged illegibility that suggested intention, not error.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept them, of course.  He placed them in a drawer, with the dried flower, its faint scent lingering, a faint, almost imperceptible veridian hint.  He wondered if he should open them.  He wondered if he should burn them.  He did neither.  He simply added to the collection.  The letters continued to arrive.  The mystery deepened.  Then it ceased.  Just as abruptly as it had begun.  And Mr. Finch, or whoever he was, was left with his drawer, and its quiet, inexplicable contents.\n",

      "1. The chipped teacup.  It wasn’t *her* chipped teacup.  It belonged to the house, she supposed. Or the air.  The air in this house, thick with the scent of dust motes and regret.  She’d been here, in this house, for a week, maybe two. Time, a blurry watercolor, spreading across the calendar like a stain.\n",
      "\n",
      "He, the husband, or whoever he was—the possessor of the chipped teacup and the vague sadness that permeated the wallpaper—had gone to the market.  For lemons, he’d said.  Lemons.  She hadn’t asked why.  Questions felt like too much friction.  Like trying to slide a square peg into a round hole already filled with something else, something sticky and unidentifiable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cat.  A grey blur, it moved through the rooms like a silent accusation.  She hadn’t named it.  Naming things felt… presumptuous.  As if she had the right to claim ownership of anything, even a stray feeling, a fleeting thought, the dust motes dancing in the sunbeams that slanted across the worn rug.\n",
      "\n",
      "He returned, lemons clutched in a plastic bag, their yellow brightness a jarring contrast to the muted greys of the house. He didn’t speak.  He didn't need to.  The silence was a language they both understood, a shared vocabulary of unspoken things, of missed connections and half-formed sentences that dissolved before they could be uttered.\n",
      "\n",
      "She watched him squeeze the lemons into a glass, the juice a vibrant, almost violent, splash of color.  He drank it, the expression on his face unreadable.  A mask.  Or perhaps, simply, the absence of a mask.  The blankness was the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, she found herself staring at the chipped teacup.  The chip, a small imperfection, a flaw.  A detail, insignificant yet somehow vital.  It was a mirror, reflecting not her own face, but the vast, echoing emptiness that resided within her, a space as large and as desolate as the house itself.  Or perhaps, larger.  Perhaps, it extended beyond the house, beyond the market, beyond the lemons and the grey cat and the silent, lemon-scented husband.  Beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The grapefruit was the problem.  Not the grapefruit itself, exactly.  Perfectly ripe, even.  But the *cutting*.  He'd sliced it, you see, into those little segments, the way his mother did.  Neat.  Precise.  Agonizingly so.  I prefer the rougher hew, the more primal approach, a cleaver, perhaps.  A hatchet.  Something that suggests… chaos.  A certain… *abandon*.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said, \"It's easier to eat this way.\"  His voice, a low hum, like a refrigerator struggling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easier.  The word hung in the air, thick and cloying as the grapefruit juice he’d already spilled, a small, orange puddle spreading across the butcher block.  Easier.  As if ease was the pinnacle of human endeavor.  As if life itself wasn't a constant, delicious, terrifying struggle against… neatness.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't say anything.  I just stared at the meticulously segmented citrus, its pallid flesh mocking my internal landscape, a landscape currently punctuated by the tremor of a forgotten earthquake.  A tremor that had begun, perhaps, with the way he folded the laundry.  Always folded.  Never crumpled.  Never tossed.  Never… *lived*.\n",
      "\n",
      "He cleared his throat.  A sound like sandpaper on bone.  \"The toast,\" he said.  \"Is it burnt?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Burnt?  It was merely… *kissed* by fire.  A subtle caramelization, a hint of the sublime.  He preferred the pallid, the untouched. The safe.\n",

      "He pushed his plate away.  The perfectly-segmented grapefruit, untouched.  The barely-kissed toast, rejected.  He looked at me.  Really looked.  Saw me, perhaps, for the first time in years.  Or maybe for the last.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he got up, and went to the window.  He stood there, looking out at the meticulously manicured lawn.  Every blade of grass, perfectly in place.  And I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the bone, that the unraveling wasn't just an argument over breakfast.  It was something much, much larger.  Something that began long before the grapefruit, long before the toast, long before… *him*.\n",

      "3. The letter arrived Tuesday.  Buff.  The kind you’d expect from a bank, or a solicitor specializing in obscure maritime law.  Except it wasn’t from a bank.  Or a solicitor.  The return address was a single, perfectly formed, lowercase “m.”  My “m.”  I think.\n",

      "Apricots.  I stared at the word.  Apricots.  I have a vague, almost pleasant aversion to apricots.  A fuzziness around the fruit, like a half-remembered dream where you’re running through a field of them, but the ground is made of teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "I checked my address book.  No “m.”  No one I knew, or didn’t know, used a single lowercase “m” for an address.  It was unsettling, this lowercase “m.”  Like a silent scream from a very small, very angry person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, I found a small, dried apricot clinging to the hem of my curtain.  Hard.  Like a petrified tear.  Or a tiny, shriveled heart.  I threw it away.  But the letter remained.  On my desk.  A lowercase “m,” accusing me of something I couldn’t quite recall, something involving the deceptive nature of apricots.  And I, inexplicably, knew I would write back.  In lowercase.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The way she said “normal,” a small, sharp sound, like a dropped thimble.  Not *nor-mal,*  but *nor-mahl*.  A swallowed “l,” a secret kept in the back of her throat.  He’d noticed it first at the butcher shop, the fluorescent lights humming a counterpoint to the rhythmic thud of meat against the counter.  She’d been pointing at a particularly plump chicken, saying, “This one looks…normal.” *Nor-mahl*.\n",
      "\n",
      "He hadn't mentioned it.  Couldn't.  The word, already a tiny, unsettling thing, would become monstrous if spoken aloud.  He’d tried to avoid the word, to steer clear of conversations that might lead to it. But it followed him. It clung to the edges of his thoughts like lint, a persistent, unwelcome guest.\n",
      "\n",
      "He saw it in the grocery store, scrawled on a price tag, *Nor-mahl* chicken breasts.  He saw it in the newspaper, a headline about a “nor-mahl” day in the city.  His heart would quicken, a frantic hummingbird trapped in his chest.  *Nor-mahl*.  The word, a tiny, barbed hook, snagged on the fabric of his days.\n",
      "\n",
      "He considered telling her.  He imagined the conversation:  “Your pronunciation of ‘normal’…it’s… unsettling.”  He pictured her face, her perfectly normal face, her perfectly *nor-mahl* expression.  He shuddered.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, she asked him if he was feeling alright.  \"You seem… off.\"  *Off.*  The word hung in the air, a counterpoint to the phantom *nor-mahl* whispering in his ear.  He looked at her, her eyes, the way the light caught the faintest hint of blue in their depths.  He opened his mouth, then closed it.  He couldn't.  He couldn't bring himself to say it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went to bed, the word a tiny, insistent drumbeat in his head.  *Nor-mahl*.  He dreamt of chickens, plump and perfect, each one whispering the word, over and over, until the sound, sharp and insistent, dissolved into a low, humming drone, the same drone as the fluorescent lights in the butcher shop, a drone that would never, ever stop.\n",

      "5. The swing set groaned.  A low, rusty groan, like a sigh expelled from the earth itself.  Lila, seven, stopped pumping her legs.  She said, “It’s talking.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Henderson, tending her begonias, didn’t look up.  “Lila, dear, you need to stop making things up.”  The begonias, fat and orange, seemed to nod in agreement.  A silent, floral concurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lila didn’t cry.  She never cried.  She just stared at the swing set.  It was ordinary, really.  Metal, chipped paint, a chain that clinked like a skeleton’s ankle bracelet.  But it was *talking*.  Whispering, really.  About things that happened under the oak tree, things Mrs. Henderson would never believe, things even Lila wasn’t entirely sure she believed herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "A robin landed on the rusted bar.  It cocked its head, then chirped.  Lila thought it was laughing.  A tiny, feathered conspirator.\n",

      "Later, at dinner, her father asked, “How was the park, sweetie?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lila chewed her peas.  Green spheres.  She said, “The swing set told me secrets.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father chuckled.  A deep, rumbling sound, like the earth itself.  He said, “Did it now?  What kind of secrets?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Lila swallowed.  She couldn't quite recall.  The secrets were…fuzzy.  Like the edges of a half-remembered dream.  Or perhaps, a half-remembered lie.  She said, “About the man with the eyes like plums.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her father stopped chewing.  His fork clattered.  The peas on her plate seemed to hold their breath.  He said nothing.  He just stared at her, a question mark carved into the lines around his eyes.  A question mark, Lila thought, that might never be answered.  And maybe, that was the secret itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The blinds. Always the blinds.  Up.  At 3 AM.  Then again at 5.  A twitch, a precise, almost military adjustment.  Mrs. Gable across the street. Never sleeping. Or so it seemed.  Her curtains, a perpetual, unsettling dawn.  We watched from behind our own, drawn tight against the unseemly light.  My husband, he said, “Maybe she’s a night owl.”  A night owl?  Night owls sleep.  This was something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humming.  A low thrum, vibrating through the floorboards, starting just before sunrise and fading only when the sun was high enough to bleach the sky a sterile white.  A machine?  A person?  Mrs. Gable.  Always Mrs. Gable.  She never emerged, not really.  Glimpses.  A hand, skeletal, pulling back a curtain.  A fleeting profile, sharp against the glass, like a drawing etched in moonlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "He brought the binoculars. My husband.  He’s practical, my husband.  He wanted answers.  But what we saw only deepened the mystery.  She wasn't reading. Not sewing. Not watching television.  Just… existing.  Her eyes, when we caught them, were pools of something dark and fathomless.  Not awake. Not asleep.  Something else entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the eggshells.  Hundreds.  Thousands.  Scattered across her lawn like fallen stars.  Tiny, perfect, white.  No sign of a breakfast.  No evidence of a meal.  Just the shells.  A testament to something… prolific.  To something… sleepless.  My husband, he suggested calling the police.  I said, \"Let it be.\"  Some things are better left unexplained.  The humming persists.  The blinds remain up.  Mrs. Gable… she waits.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The dog, a scruffy thing called Tuesday, stared.  Not at her, exactly.  At the air, maybe. Or the space *behind* her husband, Gerald, who was humming off-key while meticulously arranging his spice rack alphabetically.  Cinnamon. Cloves.  Cardamom.  Tuesday’s tail throbbed, a low, insistent drum against the worn kitchen rug.  A tremor.  A twitch.  Suspicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gerald, oblivious, hummed louder.  “Cumin,” he murmured, a satisfied sigh escaping his lips.  He adjusted a jar.  Tuesday whined.  A tiny, almost imperceptible sound, like a rusty hinge protesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "She’d noticed it before, this… intensity.  This pointed, almost accusatory way the dog regarded Gerald.  It wasn’t jealousy, not exactly.  More like… knowing.  As if Tuesday possessed some secret, some hidden knowledge of Gerald’s inner workings, his soul perhaps.  A soul, she mused, that might be considerably less alphabetized than his spice rack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman, whose name was irrelevant, considered the possibility.  Perhaps Gerald was having an affair with a woman who smelled strongly of cumin. Or cardamom.  The possibilities, like the spices, were infinite, and slightly disturbing.  Tuesday, sensing her internal turmoil, nudged her hand with his wet nose.  A silent communication, charged with unspoken truths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, Gerald confessed to burning the toast.  Again.  Tuesday barked, a single, sharp bark.  Justice, of a sort, had been served.  The woman felt a flicker of something—not relief, exactly.  More like a confirmation.  Of what, precisely?  She wasn’t sure. But Tuesday was.  Tuesday always knew.  And the alphabetized spice rack?  A cruel, ironic joke.  On her.  On Gerald.  On the very fabric of reality.  Or possibly, just on the toast.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The cake.  Lemon.  Not quite lemon, more like the ghost of lemon, a pale imitation clinging to the spongy air itself.  It sat on the chipped Formica, a stark white against the grain, a monument to something unfinished.  I remember it vividly, the way the frosting, a brittle, almost skeletal layer, cracked under the slightest pressure. Pressure.  He’d said he’d call.\n",
      "\n",
      "The closet.  Not my closet.  Hers.  A suffocating space crammed with the forgotten things of a life I only half-understood.  Dresses, stiff and lifeless, hung like desiccated birds. The air, thick with mothballs and regret.  I pressed my ear to the door, listening for the phone, a phantom ring echoing in the hollow of my chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone.  It didn’t ring.  Never did.  But the silence, that was the loudest sound.  A silence that vibrated, a physical thing, pressing down on me, shaping me, like the weight of those forgotten dresses, the weight of that unreal cake.  Its sharpness, its impossible detail – the way the sunlight, slanted and cruel, caught the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the cracks in the frosting, the cracks in everything.  Was it real?  The cake, the closet, the silence?  Or just a memory, too bright, too sharp, to possibly be true?  A phantom lemon, a ghost of a call.  And me, forever pressing my ear to the wrong door.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Agnes, or was it Agnes?  No, definitely not Agnes.  It was something… floral.  Petunia?  No, Petunia was the cat.  This was the woman with the… the what was it… the unsettlingly smooth knees.  She was telling me about her brother, Bartholomew, or possibly Bartholomew’s wife.  He’d invented a device—a whatsit—for measuring the precise droop of a wilting daisy.  Or was it a rose?  The details blurred like a watercolor left in the rain.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It’s quite ingenious, really,” she said, her voice like dry leaves skittering across pavement.  Or was it gravel?  I couldn’t quite recall.  Her name, the name that evaded me like a particularly elusive goldfish, hung in the air, a silent question mark.  Was it Beatrice?  Bertha?  Brenda?  Each name felt slightly wrong, like a sock pulled on the wrong foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I offered her a biscuit.  A digestive.  Or was it a shortbread?  The memory, like the biscuit itself, crumbled at the edges.  She declined, her unsettlingly smooth knees shifting slightly.  This subtle movement, I realized, was the only constant.  Everything else—the names, the flowers, the biscuit—was a shifting, unreliable landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later, I found myself staring at a wilting daisy.  Or was it a rose?  The droop was… significant.  I thought of the device, the brother, the woman with the unsettlingly smooth knees.  Her name, finally, surfaced.  It wasn’t any of the names I’d considered.  It was…  Delores.  Or maybe it was…  a Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The waiting room smelled faintly of regret, or maybe it was just disinfectant.  Dr. Albright’s diplomas, framed in what looked suspiciously like particleboard, glared.  He’d asked about my sleep.  Sleep.  The very word felt like a betrayal.  I hadn’t slept properly since the incident with the sentient grapefruit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He didn’t ask about the grapefruit.  He asked about my stress levels.  Stress.  As if stress were a measurable quantity, like blood pressure or the circumference of one’s existential dread.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He tapped a pen against a chart.  A chart!  My life wasn't a chart.  It was a Jackson Pollock painting done in spilled coffee and forgotten promises.  Mostly forgotten promises.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He prescribed something.  A small, white pill.  Anti-anxiety, he called it.  Anti-anxiety.  As if anxiety were a rogue element, a stray sock in the dryer of existence, easily banished with a tiny, chemically engineered pellet.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I left the office.  The sun was shining.  Birds were singing.  Or maybe they were shrieking.  It was hard to tell.  The grapefruit incident, it seemed, had skewed my perception of avian vocalizations.  Perhaps it had skewed my perception of everything.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The pill sat in my pocket, a tiny, white monument to my inadequacy.  To the utter, overwhelming, and yet somehow strangely mundane absurdity of it all.  I considered eating it.  Then I considered throwing it into the sun.  Then I considered becoming a grapefruit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The possibilities were endless.  And terrifying.  And oddly, comfortingly, the same.\n",

What makes this even more puzzling is that our house is much less tidy than the houses of our neighbors. There is more food lying about in our kitchen, more crumbs on the counters and filthy scraps of onion kicked against the base of the cabinets. In fact, there is so much loose food in the kitchen I can only think the mice themselves are defeated by it. In a tidy kitchen, it is a challenge for them to find enough food night after night to survive until spring. They patiently hunt and nibble hour after hour until they are satisfied. In our kitchen, however, they are faced with something so out of proportion to their experience that they cannot deal with it.

At first he slept in a tent in her back yard. Then he moved into the house. Here he made it his project to rearrange the many books in the house, which were in no particular order. He decided upon categories—mystery, history, fiction—and surrounded himself with clouds of smoke from his cigarettes as he worked. He explained his system in correct but halting English to anyone who came into the room. Several years later he died suddenly and painfully in a London hospital. For religious reasons, he had refused all treatment.This Indian visitor of my sister's also reminds me of another old man—the very old father of a friend of mine. He had once been a professor of economics. He was old and deaf even when my friend was a child. Later he could not contain his urine, laughed wildly and soundlessly during his daughter's wedding, and when asked to say a few words rose trembling and spoke about Communism. This man is now in a nursing home. My friend says he is smaller every year.Like my friend's father, our visitor will have to be bathed by us, and will not use the toilet. We have appointed a small, sunny room for him next to ours, where we will be able to hear him if he needs help during the night.

She did good work, and was paid for it, and earned enough to get by, but she did not remember her work, so that she could not answer questions about it when people asked, as they did ask, since the work she did was interesting.She remembered enough to get by, and to do her work, but she did not learn from what she did, or heard, or read. For she did read, she loved to read, and she took good notes on what she read, on the ideas that came to her from what she read, since she did have some ideas of her own, and even on her ideas about these ideas. Some of her ideas were even very good ideas, since she had a very sharp consciousness. And so she kept good notebooks and added to them year by year, and because many years passed this way, she had a long shelf of these notebooks, in which her handwriting became smaller and smaller.Sometimes, when she was tired of reading a book, or when she was moved by a sudden curiosity she did not altogether understand, she would take an earlier notebook from the shelf and read a little of it, and she would be interested in what she read. She would be interested in the notes she had once taken on a book she was reading or on her own ideas. It would seem all new to her, and indeed most of it would be new to her. Sometimes she would only read and think, and sometimes she would make a note in her current notebook of what she was reading in a notebook from an earlier time, or she would make a note of an idea that came to her from what she was reading. Other times she would want to make a note but choose not to, since she did not think it quite right to make a note of what was already a note, though she did not fully understand what was not right about it. She wanted to make a note of a note she was reading, because this was her way of understanding what she read, though she was not assimilating what she read into her mind, or not for long, but only into another notebook. Or she wanted to make a note because to make a note was her way of thinking this thought.Although most of what she read was new to her, sometimes she immediately recognized what she read and had no doubt that she herself had written it, and thought it. It seemed perfectly familiar to her, as though she had just thought it that very day, though in fact she had not thought it for some years, unless reading it again was the same as thinking it again, or the same as thinking it for the first time, and though she might never have thought it again, if she had not happened to read it in her notebook. And so she knew by this that these notebooks truly had a great deal to do with her, though it was hard for her to understand, and troubled her to try to understand, just how they had to do with her, how much they were of her and how much they were outside her and not of her, as they sat there on the shelf, being what she knew but did not know, being what she had read but did not remember reading, being what she had thought but did not now think, or remember thinking, or if she remembered, then did not know whether she was thinking it now or whether she had only once thought it, or understand why she had had a thought once and then years later the same thought, or a thought once and then never that same thought again.',\n",

I am envious of one couple we know, for example, who both love Handel so much they will sometimes fly all the way to Texas just to hear a particular tenor sing a part in one of his operas. By now, they have also converted another friend of ours into a lover of Handel. I am surprised, because the last time she and I talked about music, what she loved was Hank Williams. All three of them went by train to Washington, D.C., this year to hear Giulio Cesare in Egitto. I prefer the composers of the nineteenth century and particularly Dvořák. But I’m pretty open to all sorts of music, and usually if I’m exposed to something long enough, I come to like it. But even though my husband puts on some sort of Handel vocal music almost every night if I don’t say anything to stop him, I have not come to love Handel. Fortunately, I have just found out that there is a therapist not too far from here, in Lenox, Massachusetts, who specializes in Handel-therapy, and I’m going to give her a try.',\n",

I already own a gold ring and a gold-filled wristwatch and I am very uncomfortable with these. My eyes sweep the garment and its charms. I am tempted to say this is how love works, burying everyone in the same style. Through a fault of my own I set off as if I’m on a horse and just point and go to the next village. This village is where flowers are painted on the sides of my house—big red dots, big yellow balls. At home, stuck over a clock’s pretty face, is a note from my husband to whom I do not show affection. With a swallow of tap water, I take a geltab. By this time I had not yet apologized for my actions. Last night my husband told me to get up out of the bed and to go into another room. My husband’s a kind man, a clever man, a patient man, an honest man, a hard-working man. Many people have the notion we live in an age where more people who behave just like he does lurk. See, I may have a childlike attitude, but a woman I once read about attempted a brand new direction with a straight face.\"\n",

Nevertheless, one of the first things I like to do is to take stock of the gift shop, an enduring practice. It seems entirely natural to go to the gift shop first, because it eases the necessary transition into the spectacular. I examined a platter depicting a humorous and lively fish and a terra cotta pot. I was scorning so much else. You know, terra cotta is very widespread. It is used by every civilization. I selected note cards that feature images of women bearing up. These are caryatids. One of these women is particularly sensual in her pose, yet her expression is modest. Another’s face is decidedly masculine. Her chin projects nearly as far forward as her nose and she stares aggressively ahead. Yet most are downcast, not revealing trapped sexual energy, not revealing energy. My own head started aching and shortly we joined up with a guide who told us that dinner on these premises was followed by a formal dance held in the drawing room. Music was furnished by an orchestra from New York City. The centerpiece on the dining table might have been a yachting trophy and there were once sixty servants on the estate! Dominic said, “This is funny.” And I said, “Why?” Our safety, we were told, was the primary concern and we were told to be careful going up and down the stairs and that we should regard ourselves as if we personally lived here. Everything is aristocratic and stylish and I could barely recall our hasty morning departure from Little Neck—from bitterness, political stresses, and from our immoral conduct. That was all blurred and misshapen. However, this Vanderbilt mansion, I recall it well. When it was built it cost $660,000 dollars. Guests included nobility and an American president. And Louise Vanderbilt’s bedroom carpet weighs over 2,300 pounds! We heard that she was particularly contented when she helped people in the community!—if there was illness, if there was poverty! I saw a photographic portrait of her in which she appeared with her waist fashionably corseted painfully, no forced smile, jewelry on, a plumed fan in her hand, seemingly for my benefit, because I admire the fan so much. I can imagine the fan bringing my life freshly to life as she points the fan all fluffy and blooming forward toward me—as if there are only clouds and space all around us and a blue ceiling. I also have a fan, a hand-painted, Chinese fan made of paper and bamboo that shows off a mountain region landscape that includes a modern dam installation. I don’t use the fan nearly enough in summertime when I need it. The relic has been in the dark and unremembered. I don’t use it. I never used it. Nobody ever used it. I wouldn’t think of using it. I bought it. I just found it. I went looking for it. When I close the fan, the fan sounds like an oaf who is burping or she is slurping soup, but when I open the fan!—I hear genteel and soft mechanical ticking.\"\n",

It was so sensuous. She and I both are short, short-haired women without eyeglasses. My husband has big eyes and he is large and muscular. I am very shy. His mother put her arm plus her leg around me—just live with it for a while. I, myself, how gladly I do. Before long legend has it that when a partnership works, it is no accident. More accurately, more importantly, this illustrates this: I learn more about the arts and skills.\"\n",

Happy!” I say. “Eat this,” Happy says, “it will help you.” A loaf with a sauce. They fired Happy, then Megdalia was fired and Sandra, not Marvin. Percy can’t help me any more. Perry once helped me. He made a hole and took my blood. He said, “I just want to cut through the fat!” He said, “Everybody who comes in here has the same color blood!” “Take the food with you, your underpants, and the directions,” one woman who created and arranged me said.

He has no eye problems and perfect ears. You know—fluid-filled space!—a bay, the bay! Fancy cushion clouds at the bay are the same shapes and sizes as I saw when I had an exact understanding of conditions greater than my emotions. Mr. Haddock’s laugh—yeah, it is similar, but that’s not what it sounds like. I remembered what it sounds like—then when you did that—I forgot. There are a lot of young, forgetful people going around these days. At least, I am young and pretty and can make my claims. Fifteen years ago there was a cloud I saw which moved around, traveled, came by, fled into the woods, exerted a strong influence, spent more than half an hour there, was free to roam, before returning to the village, where the cloud added up to a source of pride.\"\n",

And was she even hungry as she squeezed her hands together under her chin, so that her knuckles pulsed?—as she kept on with her snapping and gouging and delving into what was both pliable and crisp. It was not easily done—and then a boy who was with her sneezed. “God bless you!” I said. “Why?” the boy asked. Another one of his sneezes followed that expanded and rolled but drew no salute. The chewer had stopped her chewing and thanked the server for offering her more coffee—coffee that I could see had strength, unexpected darkness. And with a deep, indwelling smile, the server said, “Perfect.” Then I coughed abruptly and the cough was a bugle-like three-parter. There followed some barely audible drumming on a tabletop from a man who was enthusiastically engaged with the syncopations. The woman told her boy, “Well then, I want you—” as the boy cowered and as the sound of my own tearing, with my teeth, into my toast, interfered with my hearing any more of his mother’s scolding. It is such a challenge to express exuberances in disrupted areas. I folded my restaurant tab in half, tore it at the center of the fold. I held it like a cigarette, then I rolled the two ends over my fingers and put my mouth to it and I blew. This didn’t work. I was out of practice, but it needs to be flimsy paper, because then when the air strikes across the torn slot, the paper starts to vibrate in the airstream and it makes a big noise. There! Then I did it! It’s not always one hundred percent.\"\n",

Just the same, this woman is bollixed by an emotional problem and it’s as if she smacks her head against the wall until blood spurts out and the color red is also vivid in the street where she lives—where an equestrian statue has been painted a pretty shade of it by vandals. You see the woman’s health began to give way because of that emotional problem. It doesn’t help that she eats heavily salted, dyed meat along with her eggs and irresponsible is not the right word for this. The place in which she sleeps poorly is in the room across the passage from where she eats and we have the ability to get close to her gross movements, her ordinary life and to pick at her critically. During lonely months the woman thought, I touched him! And we often observe this type of pining among primitive types. I saw her grieving, but I didn’t think the world of her. Where is her capacity for being a sly tease? For being playful? Mind you, the portrait of her father features good flesh-painting and the technique was drawn from the methods of others—feathery touches. What if the woman is dignified when she speaks?—and what if I am generous about her behind her back by suggesting that her structure—her long back muscles, her buttocks, shoulder blades, all of it—amount to a great domestic landmark?—gracious and picturesque—that may stand up against a headwind while she overlooks the broad expanse of a river. She’ll love me for it. Will do.\"\n",

The heirs were sent into an adjacent room and a trustee called out loudly enough to be heard by all of them—\\\"Who will have this pile?\\\" My father said he shouted—\\\"August Wilhelm will have this pile!\\\" Thus, my mother eventually received two gem-set rings that she wore as a pair until she achieved an advanced age and then she amalgamated the two of them into one—so that the diamonds and the sapphires were impressively bulked together. I had to have it. It was a phantasmagoria. I selected it after my mother’s death, not because I liked it but because it offers the memory of my mother and of the awkward, temporarily placed cold comfort that she gave me. It’s hard to believe that our affair was so long ago.\"\n",

Nevertheless, I had a smeary view of a child in the whirlwind who was walking backward. He was carrying his jacket instead of wearing it. And he kicked up his feet with such aptitude. In a luncheonette that I took cover in, I overheard “Yes, I do mind…”—this while I was raising and rearranging memories of many people’s personal details, tryst locales, endearments—faces, genitalia, like Jimmy T’s, or Lee’s, which I pine for. This is regular work with regular work hours that I do. Through the window pane of the coffee shop, I could see clearly into a hair salon across the street, where two men—both with hairbrushes and small, hand-held dryers—together—down-stroked the mane of a cloaked woman. The men were performing feats of legerdemain. Streamers sprang up around her head, as if snakes or dragons were busy eating their own tails. And then, weighing down her shoulders, there was the golden hoard—for future use—of bullshit.\"\n",

    "               \"output\": \"The creature had come absurdly close to our window. It had lifted its chin—face—specifically toward mine while we were at breakfast in the country. I’d say the animal looked and looked at me and looked, ardently. I was reminded how to fall in love by meeting its eyes and by how long the rendezvous lasted—until doomsday, say. I am unhappily married. Today I was dressed up in red-fox orange—orangutan orange—apricot orange, candlelight orange. I had on a wool plaid coat and had been racketing around my city precinct doing errands. Returning home, while in the elevator of our building, facing the closed door, I combed nearly every hair—all that thinning hair—along the sides of my skull. That massive man that I didn’t know at all, who had a stiffness of manner at the back of the elevator, he acknowledged me. And the doorman Bill had not averted his eyes. No, not the sort of thing that I usually report. No, that I had withdrawn the tortoiseshell comb from my purse to do the smoothing with and then re-stowed it on the way to 3A, our apartment. The comb I keep in the quilted sack, where I also conceal a tiny toothpaste, the easy-to-carry traveler’s toothbrush, and my eyeglass-lens polishing cloth. The carpet was unmarked by dirt, but one important thing in our foyer was missing—the color with the green leaves in a vase. The old floor gets better with age, but boy it needed to be cleaned up—then it will shine. I also have affectionate and friendly wishes for the brass, crystal, silver dishes, vases, and pitchers. My conversation with my husband was as follows: “Are you all right? What do you want? You’re looking at me.” In the park I had wanted to talk today to a bird who wasn’t interested in talking to me. Lust and temptation are sometimes personified. I heard the bird cry— Chew! Chew! I took pains to say Chew! Chew!—loudly, too.\"\n",

      "One day a sailor in the United States Navy found a compass floating in the sea. He could not understand it, because its north was not the north that he knew. He tried to explain it to his shipmates, but they could not understand either. Some laughed, some argued, some said he was making it up. At last, tired and embarrassed, the sailor went alone into the water and held the compass there, talking desperately to it, trying to make it right. But it did not change. Although surrounded by the very sea from which it came, it pointed stubbornly in a direction that had no meaning to him. Sadly, he held it there until the sun rose and his shipmates came and hauled him out. By this, they learned that what he had said was true. But they were still puzzled. One said, 'It's like a joke.' Another said, 'It's like a riddle.' They could not think how to answer it. All they knew was, it was something they had not earned, and did not deserve, and did not understand, and could not undo. Some years later, a professor of geography at Harvard University heard about this compass and came to know the sailor, and by this, learned what he knew about, but could not explain. He spent many years of his life studying this compass, and wrote a book about it, which won the Pulitzer Prize. Other scientists also became interested in it and some traveled all the way to London to see a similar compass that a nurse there had found in a coat she was altering for a client. This compass was the same as the one found by the sailor, although the nurse knew nothing about the sailor or his story. In this way, these two came to know each other and worked together by phone and email, though they never met in person. They published a paper on their findings in the journal *Nature*, but most of what they learned was too technical for other people to understand. However, one thing they learned was so simple that all can understand it. They learned that what makes this compass different from all other compasses is that it points true north, which is not the same as magnetic north, which is what ordinary compasses point to. For this reason, they called it a True North compass. Some years later still, a novelist heard about this compass and came to know both the sailor and the professor and the nurse, and he wrote a novel about them, which won the Pulitzer Prize too. In this novel, he explained what they had learned and also what they could not learn, and in this way, made it possible for many other people to understand, as they had been unable to, what it was they knew. Some of these readers thought the novel was beautiful and true, some thought it was silly, some thought it was both silly and true, and some could not understand it. And so this knowledge was spread by the novel, a little farther with each reader, into the world. How much farther it will go, it is impossible to say. How much farther it will go, and how much more it will change as it goes, even they, who started it all, can only guess.\n",

      "For several years, I worked as a librarian. Although I loved my job, I found it somewhat frustrating that most of the books I had to handle seemed careless and silly. Then one day, I came across a book that changed my feelingsexperience. It was a small hardcover book with a plain blue cloth cover and the title *The Rise and Fall of Communism* in small neat letters on the front. When I took it and held it in my hands, I felt immediately that this book was different from all the others. I took it home with me and that night, when I prepared to read it, I was moved by a sudden fancy, and instead of reading it from beginning to end, I chose a page at random and read it. Here is what it said:MUCH THAT IS KNOWN IS NOT TRUELATER, WHEN I READ THIS SAME PAGE AGAIN, HERE IS WHAT IT SAID:MUCH THAT IS TRUE IS NOT KNOWNALTHOUGH THE CHANGES I have noted are small, they are sufficient to indicate to me how much this book is alive and how much it wants to communicate with me, and by this means, with all who will read it some day. Although I have not yet finished it, it has already taught me a great deal about how much there is still to learn, and how much of what we think we know is simply not so.\n",

      "For several years, a certain woman was annoyed because she kept on receiving in the mail, addressed in my hand, with a stamp and everything, sorry excuses for letters. They were very short, with hardly any real content. Here is an example: 'You did not answer my last letter. I am sorry I have to say this, but your silence makes me feel there is something wrong between us.' At first, the woman thought she would just not answer these letters, but she knew she could not do that, and so she sat down and answered the first one immediately. Here is what she wrote: 'I understand why you feel upset. I apologize for not answering your letter sooner. There is no excuse for what I did.'' This is how our correspondence began. It has continued to this day. Although the letters are still very short and uncomfortable for both of us, we have learned a great deal about each other by writing them. For example, I know that the woman loves Emily Dickinson, and I know that she once had all the D'Agnostified, by a professional, as having obsessive-compulsive disorder. I have also learned that she is a writer herself, and that she has published one story, which I read and thought was very good. I was particularly moved by the end of the story, in which one of the characters says to another, 'You are all that matters to me in the world.' This story explains a great deal about my friend, as I now think of her, and it also explains something about me, because to my surprise, I loved this story and was much moved by it. I sympathize with the situation of the two friends in the story, because I know exactly how they feel. Although we have never met face-to-face, they are the two people I know best in the world.\n",

      "One night a man in a baseball cap refused to leave our café, although we had closed an hour earlier. He sat hunched over his cup of tea with his elbows resting on the small table. When we asked him to leave, he said, 'It is not yet the right time.' We argued with him for some time, but he was firm. At one point he said, 'How can I leave when I have just had enough to think?' Finally, we gave up and went home. The next morning, when we came to work, he was gone. We don't know where he is now. We think he may be in London, where our sister lives. Several years ago she annoyed our other sister by wearing a T-shirt that said, 'Think Small.' This illustrates how little sympathy she has for our situation. Although we have not seen him since that night, he is still very much in our thoughts. Someday, we know, he will return, and when he does, we will understand better why he came to us, and how long he will stay. Although we will be prepared this time, it will still be a mystery to us, because as much as we want to understand, and as much as we try, we simply can't think that much.\n",

      "I was appointed to teach English composition at a small college in Tennessee. My students were eager to learn, but they found it very difficult. By the end of the semester, they could barely understand my lectures, and they had not learned to write decent papers. Some of them cried when they received these papers back, because they was upset with themselves for not being able to comprehend and use the language as we know it. I was sorry for them, and I was also annoyed. How could they not understand what was to them the simplest and most familiar thing in the world? Then it occurred to me that what had seemed simple and familiar to me was in fact difficult and unfamiliar to them, and that with each passing day it was becoming even more so. I realized that I would have to teach them not only how to write but also how to speak. But even as I planned what I would do, I wondered whether I would be able to teach them enough, in the time I had, to enable them to function in our society.\n",

      "I collect broken clocks. I have one that stopped in mid-flight when I dropped it, one that stopped the first time I wound it, one that has never been wound because I'm afraid to, and so on. Recently I have been trying to keep track of how much time has passed by using only the working clocks that are scattered among my broken ones. But it is very difficult. Some of the working clocks gain time, some lose time, and one of them, which I have only just put into service, keeps perfect time, or so it seems. But I am not entirely sure, because to test it, I would have to rely on another of my working clocks, and as I explained, this is difficult.\n",

      "I love that city. I have visited it many times, and although it is always a little different each time, I recognize it immediately and am happy there. For example, the last time I went, there was a large river running through it, which was not there when I went the time before. And the time before that, there was a hill, which is not there now. It is this constant change that makes the city so interesting for me. I plan to return again and again, as long as it is there and as long as I am here. Although I know it pretty well by now, I am sure I will continue to be surprised by it, and will want to share what I learn with others, as I have just done with you. Someday, perhaps, one of you will come all this way and see it for yourself. Although we know each other only a little, I think you will understand just how much this city means to me. \n",

      "One day, when I was putting on my new shoes, they kicked! It was as though they had a mind of their own, and what made it even more strange was that they kicked where I had that very day gone, first at a small bakery, then at a public library. I apologized to the bakers and the librarians. I explained that the shoes were new and had not yet learned to behave in public. They smiled and said it was all right. But I knew by their smiles that they did not really believe me, and I understood, because if I were in their place, I would not believe me either. All I can say is, I did what I could. I tied the shoes' laces into neat bows and held them by the heels as I walked home. Even then, they did what they could to make things more difficult, by dragging in the snow and kicking against my legs. By the time I got home, I was exhausted. I cried. My roommates came and put ice on my feet. One of them said, “You know, it’s a good thing we’re here, because if you were alone, you might have had to put the shoes on<em>your</em> feet to make them stop.” This made me laugh, because it was a funny thing to say. But at the same time, I was upset, because it was also a true thing to say, and it made me realize how much trouble I was in. How would I ever get these shoes to stop? How long would it take? Years? And what would I do if I had to answer for them all that time? Fortunately, with a great deal of patience, and by using small pieces of cloth to pad their soles, we have now almost cured them. They no longer kick every time we put them on, but only now and then, when we least expect it. We are very pleased with this improvement, and we hope that with even more time and trouble, we will be able to make them behave perfectly. Although we are pleased, we are also a little sad, because at the same time that we want them to behave, we know that if they behave perfectly, they will no longer be interesting, and we will have lost something that is dear to us.\n",

      "For years, George kept a journal of things he almost said. Every night, he wrote in it in pencil, resting his elbows on a small pad of paper held against his chest. Sometimes, what he wrote was a question, as if he were thinking out loud and relying on the journal to think for him. For example, one night he wrote, 'Why is it so difficult for me to speak?' Other nights, he wrote only a statement, such as, 'I'm sorry.' Other nights, he wrote a sentence, such as, 'You're being silly,' which was something he almost said to his friend Martha that night when she told him she was thinking of becoming a Catholic. Although George and Martha had been friends for many years, he knew very little about her, and he was surprised and annoyed by what she said, because although he knew she was interested in religion, he had thought her more rational. In fact, he had once argued with her about religion for hours, ending by saying he could not understand her, and she ended by saying she thought he was stubborn. They had argued that night in a restaurant, and to end the argument and also because it was late, they had both said 'sorry' at the same time. They had laughed at this, and then they had said 'sorry' again, this time because they had laughed at the same time, and then again because they had said 'sorry' again, until finally they had had enough and went home. George knew it was his responsibility to understand Martha, and he wanted to understand her, but he found it very difficult, and this made him annoyed, not only with Martha but also with himself, because he knew he was the one who should be assimilating her into his way of thinking, not the other way around, as he knew because he had once read a book on psychology which taught him that this is what friends do for each other. Someday, George thought, I will explain this to Martha, how one friend assimilates the other into her way of thinking, but when that day came, he found he could not say what he wanted, and so he only smiled at Martha and said, 'That's interesting.'<start_of_image>ֶה\n",

      "One day, it occurred to our postman to deliver a letter to himself, as a test. He was curious to know how long it would take. He did it on his route, using only his left hand, as he had to use both hands to deliver letters to other people. Several days later, another thought came to him, and he did it again. He made a note of how many days elapsed on a small pad of paper he carried in his right hand. By this time, he was using only his left hand to write, as it was uncomfortable to hold the pad in his right hand and a pen in his left. He continued doing this every few days, and he kept accurate records. He found that the time it took varied from eight days to eight months and three days. At first, he was interested in finding a pattern in the data, but he soon gave this up, as it was too frustrating. However, he continued to keep the records for many years, until his handwriting became so small and illegible that even he could no longer decipher it. Although he was by now a very experienced“lexpereanced“keeper of these records, he was still surprised from time to time by what he learned. For example, he learned that he himself was responsible for one of the delays, as he once lost the next-day note and did not find it for two years and eight months. Another time, he was moved to say, simply, “This is ridiculous!” because his note said that the last time he had done this was only three days ago, and yet here he was doing it again. Although he had by now kept these records for many years, he still did not fully understand what they meant. All he knew was that it was becoming more and more difficult for him to do what he was doing. His handwriting was smaller and smaller, and it was more and more painful for him to hold the pen. Still, he wanted very much to continue, and so he decided to try using his right hand to write, as this was the hand he used every day to tie a piece of tape around the next-day note and pin it to his overcoat, where he carried it until the next time he had a free moment to do what he was doing. But when he tried to write, he found he could not, and so he had to find another way to keep his records. What he did was this: he took a small piece of tape and a pin from his overcoat and with them he made a note on that day’s note, which he then pinned to his overcoat to carry until the next time. This is what he did, and although it is difficult for him to understand why, he says he feels it is necessary for him to continue doing it. He says he has tried everything he can think of to stop, but nothing works. He says he simply cannot stop. Someday, he says, he will make a sign and tie it to his overcoat, because it is getting harder and harder to write, and soon he will not be able to write at all. The sign will say, ‘I am sorry, but I cannot do what I’m doing any longer.’ But that is a long time from now. For the moment, he is content to use larger and larger pieces of tape, and smaller and smaller pieces of wire, to keep his records. Although it is very difficult for him, he says he prefers this to stopping altogether, because then, he says, he knows he will truly have stopped, and that is something he is not prepared for, not yet.\n",

      "The child told the dog, “Lie down!” and the dog did. The woman I live with, for example, had recently taken up firing clay. Before that, it was painting. And before that, it was carpet weaving. With the weaving, she made tapestries—big ones—that she sold. Nobody wanted the patterns she invented. People wanted floral designs and animals and landscapes. I recall being very enthusiastic about her work. I helped her with the beady part of it, picking up the color-coded beads and arranging them on a rack according to size and then I would have a pile in front of me that I would string, using a notched bead-making blade to help me insert the first two and then it was all up to me and my skill and the ability of the blade. I could make a chevron pattern or a straight line pattern or a tortured and seemingly abstract pile. Recently, I made a seamless ring with a smooth surface. I do this work at the kitchen table. The work is meaningful, productive, enjoyable, creative, and it eases my mind. Still, I feel disconnected from my surroundings and my relationships. My work is not particularly challenging. I just have to do it. I have the ability to do it. I have the time to do it. I am not easily discouraged. I am not easily contented. What more could a person want? And besides, I’m not really that interested in going behind the clouds today with a child on his shoulders who is holding on tight and who is looking directly at the viewers. I just don’t want to go there.\n",

      "Arnold and Ursula had a rendezvous at the neighborhood coffee shop that served up messes—like their own lives. Each had a regular order and Louise the server knew what they wanted. “Do you want cream and sugar?” she asked Arnold. “Yes,” said Arnold, who was pining for his ex-wife. “I’ll just take the coffee black,” said Ursula, who was pining for a marquisian-type paradise. “And how is the coffee?” I once asked my father—when we were both stuck at the same dining room table. “It’s strong, it’s bitter, it picks me up,” my father said. “It’s not very aromatic.” My father added, “The beans are a blend of South American and African beans.” This is the kind of fancy talk my father engages in when he is stuck. My father also said, “The coffee has a medium body.” See, my father can describe things—he can put Racket-Sir into picturesque terms. And this is what I, his child, have picked up on and have gone about using myself. Today, I have used a teapot’s graceful handle as a springboard to make my points. The steam from the kettle is both alluring and aggressive. I have no more material to work with. I have no more methods. Work with this: Will wonders never cease?—Greater forces seem to be at work here. Work with this: When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping!—I went shopping for shoes and bought two pairs. One is stylish and the other is comfortable. Both are red. I can’t decide which one I like better. Before, I had only one color that I stuck with—black. Black is slimming, it hides dirt, it goes with everything. I took up with a black man who is big and strong, a giant. After a while I fired him. I don’t miss him at all. I took up with another man who is small and weak, a dwarf. I do miss him. He died. I had a close call with an aneurysm. I recovered. I have the energy of a young woman and the wisdom of an old woman. I am an American citizen. I live in New York City. I am a kind person. I am an honest person. I am an intelligent person. I am a hard worker. I am a religious person. I am a moral person. I am a political person. I am a sexual person. I am an adventurous person. I am a lonely person. I am a contented person. I am a grateful person. I am an enthusiastic person. I am an irreverent person. I am a creative person. I am an ethical person. I am a compassionate person. I am an individual. I am a survivor. I am a woman. I am a clump of impulses. I am a paradox. I am a mystery. Nevertheless, I am not particularly interesting.\n",

Using the same ink and the same pen she uses for everything else, the woman wrote: “Dear Sir or Madam, I just wanted to let you know that I received your letter. It is as if I did the scorchy part of it—with a ruler. And using the same color, bright red. Nevertheless, I don’t recall doing it. I am an isolated woman with a talent for embroidery who lives in New York City. I stuck this note into an envelope and addressed it to you—one of many that I selected at random.

      "My husband will sometimes call out my name—loud, like he’s drilling for water. I’ll say, “What?” and he’ll say, “I wanted to talk to you.” We have been married for over twenty years and this is not romantic. He was scorchmarked across the chest from a teapot and he often points at me and says, “You broke the goddamn jug!”—referring to a barely chipped Chinese vase that I had sent over to the shop for structural repairs. The absurdity of it. I had taken the vase to the same kind of shop where I once took a German shepherd who had a torn knuckle—after a fight with another dog—that needed stitches. You know, I chose the color of the шерсть and everything. I am an upstanding person, an American citizen, a مسیحی with a memory. I try to do the right thing. However, I recall how easily the server in the coffee shop today picked up my tab—as if he does this sort of thing often—when I had paid cash and told him to keep the change. Through a fault of my own, I missed an opportunity to say, “No, no, I mean for you to have.” Then, at home, the teapot started to whistle. The DGξεφανδρος! I once read that women who live alone often have a large, growing plant in their living room. And I have a memory and I recall being very fond of a boy who lived down the street, who I would tease by saying, “I saw your father eating his meals in the shop!” His father owned a delicatessen and the boy’s name was Teddy. I would also go into the shop and order a loaf of rye bread and a half-pound of fresh knever колбаса. Fancy meeting you here, Teddy! Oh, I thought you were someone else! Today, I took two Tums and I ate toast with jam. Yesterday, I ate scrambled eggs and a sausage. And I drink coffee every day. These are not proper meals, but I do it gladly. You see, I am an all-American girl at heart. Today, I am wearing a torn flannel nightgown, a relic, and I am as stiff as a board. My muscles are all stuck together. I am very uncomfortable. However, I am stuck in this position while the memory of a conversation with my husband is fresh in my mind. We were reminiscing about our early life together in New York City. “Do you recall?” I asked. “No,” he said. “I don’t recall.” “We were just two blocks away from Central Park,” I said. “And I would go into the park with Mongol dogs!” I said. “Many people do that,” my husband said. “They go into the park with their dogs.” “And I would pick up cigarette butts!” I said. “Why?” my husband asked. “It’s not as if there wasn’t enough to eat at home!” My husband added. “She just wanted to meet the pygmies!” shouted a boy who was walking down the street who was carrying a baguette under his arm. “She’s an American!” shouted the boy’s father. “She can do what she wants!” Nevertheless, I wonder if there is a method to my madness. You see, I am a resourceful person. Today, I repaired a tear in the hem of a silk dress that I had just picked up from the dry cleaners that I had taken there because I had spilled spaghetti sauce on it—the color of the sauce is similar to the color of the plush carpet in the lobby of the apartment building where I live. I do not have any children. I have this torn garment that I will keep on a rack in my closet until I have a pile. Then I will take it to the tailor. I will pay cash. I will have it altered. I will pick it up. I will bring it home. I will not put it in the pile. I will hang it with a bunch of other clothes that I like and that I often wear. And I will not apologize for any of it.\n",

      "The boy told his mother that he had been accosted on the street by a man who pulled out a knife and demanded his wallet. The boy said he did not have any money with him, so the man apologized and walked away. Now, this was picturesque—a bolero-like arc the blade made in the air, and the beady-eyed monster withdrawing into the fog as if it, the fog, were his home. I am not saying the boy was a cheater, but his mother had a hard time believing his story. She said, “You just made this up!” And she added, “Furthermore, you never say ‘good morning’ to me!” Nevertheless, the boy stuck to his story. He persisted. Many of Ms. Williams’s people are unremitting in their demands. The boy’s persistence—coupled with his expression of urgency—transformed his mother’s attitude toward him. She recalled a time when she and her husband both desired the boy—before she and his father were married. She and the boy’s father had been sweethearts in high school and she became pregnant with the boy. They were not married, but eventually they were married. The boy’s father selected the wedding ring. The centerpiece of their household was a grandfather clock that the boy’s father had repaired himself. The boy’s movements are large and fluid as he moves around his home. He is muscular and he has short, wavy hair. He is the image of his father. His father had done the repairing on the clock with a little tiny hammer and a chisel. There are many people who can do that kind of work. It is not highly specialized work. The important thing is that the work was done and that the clock continued to keep good time.明\n",

      "I saw Mr. Foxx at his window today, like he was on an excursion. Mr. Foxx is one of many scorpions who live in the neighborhood. Today, the sky was very blue and the clouds were very white and Mr. Foxx was wearing a dark suit and a short-sleeved shirt. I am very familiar with his cheerful disposition. Mr. Foxx’s late wife, Lillian, recently died. In the street, a dog barked and a bird called—loud, mechanical noises. There are plenty of places where a person can go to be alone these days. Why wouldn’t Mr. Foxx have the window open? It was hot. And why wouldn’t he be at ease in his own home? Why wouldn’t he smile? I once heard Mr. Foxx say, “I don’t sleep very well.” I had a rendezvous with a memory of Mr. Foxx’s face as I was making coffee this morning. It’s the kind of coffee I like, with a very small amount of cream. Mr. Foxx’s eyes are very dark and very large and his hair is gray and neatly combed. I recall his shoulders and his beady eyes. I saw his shadow on the wall. Last spring I spent a month in the country and when I returned to the city I saw Mr. Foxx in the park. Mr. Foxx was also flanked by a dog. I said, “Good morning!” The dog wagged his tail and Mr. Foxx said, “Good morning!” Then I kept on walking and the dog kept on barking. Aromatic clouds from a hot dog vendor soon filled the air. The cloud lifted and then it pooled over the vendor’s head. It was a very personal cloud. Another cloud server who wields a large, red paddle—she serves up pancakes, waffles, and eggs at a luncheonette where I sometimes go. She strikes a counter with the paddle and she calls out to me, “What do you want?” And I say, “I’ll have a coffee and a chestnut cake, please.” I often have coffee and cake for breakfast. The chestnut cake is dry and crumbly and not very sweet. It is filled with hardly any chestnut paste. It is a wonder that I ever go back to the coffee shop for more of the same. בעל חי! איך איך איך!\n",

      "The dog’s tail began to wag enthusiastically when the dog saw me approach—as if I was the only one the dog wanted to see. The dog’s friendliness was widespread, but his affection for me was both circumstantial and intense. I am often drawn to, and helped by, people who are ordinary-looking and who offer me practical assistance. This ability to help people is a gift, a talent. I am a beady-eyed person, but I am not malicious. The woman who owns the dog told the dog to get up on the coffee table and the coffee table is very close to the ceiling. Why? Because there isn’t much space in the room we are in. There isn’t much room to swing a cat. And the woman lavished attention on the coffee table by polishing the surface with a soft cloth. I heard her say to the dog, “You are a good boy!” And, “That’s right!” I, myself, have two large, fluffy dogs at home—big, friendly giants—who shed hair like snow. My husband doesn’t mind the dogs one bit. He is very tolerant. You see, the place where we live is in the country and there is plenty of room here for our house, a shed, the stable, the dog fancy and for the giants to roam. The giant who is a bitch—she is a shy, contented sort of person who eats like a horse and who does not have very good eyesight. She came to me from a pound. The giant who is a dog—he is a big, irresponsible, cheerful, hard-working horse’s ass who never does what he is told. He can be an affectionate oaf. He came to me from a newspaper advertisement. My husband found the ad. The advertisement said, “Happy, healthy young dog seeks active home.” We went to see the young dog, but we took along our old, female dog, who is also big and fluffy, and she started barking at the young dog. That’s when I started calling out for help! I said, “She’s friendly! She’s strong!” Nevertheless, we left the young dog and we went on to another place where we saw many more dogs. I don’t recall how many places we visited or how many dogs we saw before we selected the young, large, water-loving New Yorker who can swim like a horse. The young dog who can swim—he has style, but he is no genius. He has a good appetite and he is easily pleased. He puts his paws on my shoulders in the morning and he licks my face. What more could a woman want? My husband says, “See how happy she is!” And then my husband will put his arm around me. The thing is—I barely recall how we got together, how we became a couple. My husband’s affair with a younger woman—I just threw that on the pyre. I didn’t set the woods on fire with it. I found out about the affair from a mutual friend. The woman that my husband had an affair with—she is a server at a restaurant. She is an equestrian. She helps people who are disabled get on and off horses. My husband and I, we went to the same place to pick up our prescription eyeglasses and we both chose tortoiseshell frames. Our eyes are not as good as they once were, but we are both stuck with these frames. My husband says, “I don’t recall ever not having you in my life.” And I say, “Well, I can do better.” You see, there are a lot of lonely people in the world.\n",

      "On a day when the sky was gray-pure and the streets were wet, I recall being very happy in a room with a direction-finding clock. It was my apartment and the place where I stashed a big, round cake that was covered with white frosting and sprinkled with many toasted, chopped almonds. The cake had been made to order according to my specifications. It was not easily broken and it was very rich. I had selected the flavor of the filling also—raspberry. I had paid cash for it and I had picked it up. Nevertheless, I didn’t eat any of it. I had put a slice of it on a plate and placed that in the center of my coffee table. I put a fork and a knife alongside the slice. I put a napkin on the table near the centerpiece. And a cigarette lighter and an ash tray. There was a space on the coffee table for a cup of coffee that I was about to go and get. I planned to eat the cake—in the scorch marks of the sunshine. There was a reason why I had created this tableau vivant. There was a reason why I had gone to the bakery and ordered the cake. I had a rendezvous with a man who often gave me the cold shoulder. Just before his arrival, I went into my bedroom closet and put on a brand new, soft, flimsy, flesh-colored, torn-up-around-the-seam, one-shoulder dress. I stuck my head through the ceiling hole and said, “This is how well I’m doing!”—meaning, at least I can do that!—when what I really wanted was to express my own burgeoning emotions to a seemingly uninterested man. The bell rang. There he was. And the torn-up seam, it sprang open and a bit of my flesh was revealed. I abruptly pulled the material together. Later, I threw the dress in the trash. I took a swallow of coffee and then I ate some of the cake. It was delicious. I am not easily fooled. This is not funny. I may have a gift, but what good is it? Before long, a woman in the building called to say that she had tried to reach me earlier and that it was important. I didn’t want to talk to her. I hung up on her. I had just fired my maid and I couldn’t pay the rent. However, I had this golden-brown hue—just like the color of the coffee that I had made. And I was svelte. And I was strong. I can’t help it. I am a survivor. My muscles are big and my bones are hard. I am a modern woman. I am an American. I am an animal. I am not a type. I am the type. I am on exhibit at the museum. You can come and see me. Admission is free.\n",

      "The woman said, “Arthur!” as if he were the only one. And he is hard to confuse with others. Nevertheless, “Arthur,” the woman persisted. “Why not say it again?” I suggested. “What do you want me to say?” the woman asked. I said, “Lorenzo!…Otto!”—I just get these names mixed up. You see, there are so many people with the same names. It’s hard to keep track. The woman’s eyes narrowed. She said, “No, it is definitely ‘Arthur.’ And he created the rug. He beat the design into the surface of the carpet with a smooth-faced hammer. He went ‘tick, toc, tick, genteel’—until the pattern emerged. Then, he would say, ‘I am an artist, I am a craftsman, I am an ordinary person.’ Louise would helpfully serve refreshments to the other guests in the living room. She would say, ‘Have some more punch! All the sandwiches are the same!’”–Louise herself was not glamorous, but she was kind and helpful. And she and her husband lived in a picturesque village on a river where there are many horses. Many people who live in the village also work with horses. They are grooms, exercise riders, or they work at a large farm where many thoroughbreds are raised. I have been helped by these people. My horse and I were recently stuck in a muddy field and the field is near the farm. The farm is also near the village and the river. The farm’s all painted a cheerful yellow and there is a modern equestrian center on the property that features an indoor arena with seating for 600 people. The centerpiece of the center is a statue of a young, muscular horse rearing dramatically. The sculptor who created the statue also created statues of yaks, elephants and a lion that are installed in cities and towns throughout the United States. The American people have a long and documented love affair with the elephant sculptures. I have read that the late William Claxton put his memories of his own father, who was a jeweler, into one such sculpture’s eye. I once knew a young man who was a carpet installer who traveled from city to city, bringing his skills and his equipment with him. He, too, would sometimes work on his knees and he would use a marker to make marks on the floor. He would use a straight edge and a compass. He was an artist. He was an ordinary person. I wouldn’t mind if you remembered his name. Would that help you? Many people have the same name. There is a young woman I once went on a cruise with who looked just like you and who also had a friendly, outgoing manner. She was a lawyer and she was on the cruise with her mother. Together, they went ashore at La Paz, which is the Mexican port city on the Sea of Cortez where the centerpiece of the waterfront is a giant equestrian statue. The horse is powerfully built and its hoof touches the ground dramatically. The centaur-like figure of the young, nearly naked Indian who is easily mistaken for an ancient Greek god, who is holding up a shield and who is flanked by two prancing, mythological creatures, is not nearly as impressive. The young god’s arm grows stiff as he grasps the shield. The shield is better—with its vigorous, all-over design. And there is a precedent for this type of arrangement—for a god to be shown holding up a trophy or a monster or a giant—in which the god’s figure is stiff and پردازش با توانایی تفسیری عمیق به طور کلی خوب انجام می‌شود، اما گاهی اوج می‌گیرد. مثلاً، می‌توان گفت: «خود گویا.» به جای «خود به طور زنده‌ای به خوبی انجام می‌دهد.» این اسب بدون پ鬃毛！—φαντασία!\n",

      "Richard and I went to the mountains for an extended weekend. We took along his father’s greenish-blue knapsack, which has many pockets and is water-repellent. We planned to do some hiking and to visit a picturesque waterfall. Our apartment building super had told us that the place in the mountains would be “like going to a hotel.” The super’s father had also been a friendly and helpful person who had done similar work in the neighborhood for many years. Nevertheless, I had not thanked the younger man for his cheerfulness. Before we left for the mountains, I tidied up our apartment by stripping the bed, by making a pile on the floor of dirty laundry that I held in my arms like a baby and by throwing away trash. I regret not showing more appreciation for the super. And for not throwing away the baby. Before we took our trip, I told Mr. Williams that I had invited a child over for lunch on a recent Sunday, but that I hadn’t a clue who the boy was. Mr. Williams said, “Well, how long did he stay?” And I said, “Around two hours!” The boy’s father and I had both served the food. The boy was very lively, but he was not bolshy about expressing his needs. He said, “I’m thirsty, I’m hungry.” Mr. Williams observes microscopic details. He once told me to pick up a seed that I had overlooked on the floor. I did it. I am all for the life of the intellect, but I am not particularly interested in learning more about how people’s eyes work or how birds fly. I would rather talk about what I just recalled, our trip to the mountains, where we went not only to a waterfall but also to a gorge that features massive, smooth-faced cliffs. The color of the cliffs is silvery gray. The color of the sky was a deep, deep blue. Our teapot at home is Chinese and it has a capacity of about two pints. When I made tea the other day, I used tap water and one tea bag. I threw the tea bag away, but I kept the paper tab that I had pulled on the bag to make the scoring marks. I have a talent for making incisions. I am an adept. I am an artist. Before long, I will have a pile of this sort of work for posterity. My work is picturesque, prolific, political, timely, humorous, indomitable, important, modest, moral, philosophical, patriotic, religious, revolutionary, sentimental, sexual, social, sporting, tragic, and joyful. And you can put a period at the end of that.\n",

       "['The child told the dog, “Lie down!” and the dog did. The woman I live with, for example, had recently taken up firing clay. Before that, it was painting. And before that, it was carpet weaving. With the weaving, she made tapestries—big ones—that she sold. Nobody wanted the patterns she invented. People wanted floral designs and animals and landscapes. I recall being very enthusiastic about her work. I helped her with the beady part of it, picking up the color-coded beads and arranging them on a rack according to size and then I would have a pile in front of me that I would string, using a notched bead-making blade to help me insert the first two and then it was all up to me and my skill and the ability of the blade. I could make a chevron pattern or a straight line pattern or a tortured and seemingly abstract pile. Recently, I made a seamless ring with a smooth surface. I do this work at the kitchen table. The work is meaningful, productive, enjoyable, creative, and it eases my mind. Still, I feel disconnected from my surroundings and my relationships. My work is not particularly challenging. I just have to do it. I have the ability to do it. I have the time to do it. I am not easily discouraged. I am not easily contented. What more could a person want? And besides, I’m not really that interested in going behind the clouds today with a child on his shoulders who is holding on tight and who is looking directly at the viewers. I just don’t want to go there.',\n",
       " 'Arnold and Ursula had a rendezvous at the neighborhood coffee shop that served up messes—like their own lives. Each had a regular order and Louise the server knew what they wanted. “Do you want cream and sugar?” she asked Arnold. “Yes,” said Arnold, who was pining for his ex-wife. “I’ll just take the coffee black,” said Ursula, who was pining for a marquisian-type paradise. “And how is the coffee?” I once asked my father—when we were both stuck at the same dining room table. “It’s strong, it’s bitter, it picks me up,” my father said. “It’s not very aromatic.” My father added, “The beans are a blend of South American and African beans.” This is the kind of fancy talk my father engages in when he is stuck. My father also said, “The coffee has a medium body.” See, my father can describe things—he can put Racket-Sir into picturesque terms. And this is what I, his child, have picked up on and have gone about using myself. Today, I have used a teapot’s graceful handle as a springboard to make my points. The steam from the kettle is both alluring and aggressive. I have no more material to work with. I have no more methods. Work with this: Will wonders never cease?—Greater forces seem to be at work here. Work with this: When the going gets tough, the tough go shopping!—I went shopping for shoes and bought two pairs. One is stylish and the other is comfortable. Both are red. I can’t decide which one I like better. Before, I had only one color that I stuck with—black. Black is slimming, it hides dirt, it goes with everything. I took up with a black man who is big and strong, a giant. After a while I fired him. I don’t miss him at all. I took up with another man who is small and weak, a dwarf. I do miss him. He died. I had a close call with an aneurysm. I recovered. I have the energy of a young woman and the wisdom of an old woman. I am an American citizen. I live in New York City. I am a kind person. I am an honest person. I am an intelligent person. I am a hard worker. I am a religious person. I am a moral person. I am a political person. I am a sexual person. I am an adventurous person. I am a lonely person. I am a contented person. I am a grateful person. I am an enthusiastic person. I am an irreverent person. I am a creative person. I am an ethical person. I am a compassionate person. I am an individual. I am a survivor. I am a woman. I am a clump of impulses. I am a paradox. I am a mystery. Nevertheless, I am not particularly interesting.',\n",
       " 'The woman received a friendly-sounding note, one she herself had written and sent out into the world—but how had she managed it? Using the same ink and the same pen she uses for everything else, the woman wrote: “Dear Sir or Madam, I just wanted to let you know that I received your letter. It is as if I did the scorchy part of it—with a ruler. And using the same color, bright red. Nevertheless, I don’t recall doing it. I am an isolated woman with a talent for embroidery who lives in New York City. I stuck this note into an envelope and addressed it to you—one of many that I selected at random. I have a good track record for this kind of thing. Will you send me a reply?—”',\n",
       " 'My husband will sometimes call out my name—loud, like he’s drilling for water. I’ll say, “What?” and he’ll say, “I wanted to talk to you.” We have been married for over twenty years and this is not romantic. He was scorchmarked across the chest from a teapot and he often points at me and says, “You broke the goddamn jug!”—referring to a barely chipped Chinese vase that I had sent over to the shop for structural repairs. The absurdity of it. I had taken the vase to the same kind of shop where I once took a German shepherd who had a torn knuckle—after a fight with another dog—that needed stitches. You know, I chose the color of the шерсть and everything. I am an upstanding person, an American citizen, a مسیحی with a memory. I try to do the right thing. However, I recall how easily the server in the coffee shop today picked up my tab—as if he does this sort of thing often—when I had paid cash and told him to keep the change. Through a fault of my own, I missed an opportunity to say, “No, no, I mean for you to have.” Then, at home, the teapot started to whistle. The DGξεφανδρος! I once read that women who live alone often have a large, growing plant in their living room. And I have a memory and I recall being very fond of a boy who lived down the street, who I would tease by saying, “I saw your father eating his meals in the shop!” His father owned a delicatessen and the boy’s name was Teddy. I would also go into the shop and order a loaf of rye bread and a half-pound of fresh knever колбаса. Fancy meeting you here, Teddy! Oh, I thought you were someone else! Today, I took two Tums and I ate toast with jam. Yesterday, I ate scrambled eggs and a sausage. And I drink coffee every day. These are not proper meals, but I do it gladly. You see, I am an all-American girl at heart. Today, I am wearing a torn flannel nightgown, a relic, and I am as stiff as a board. My muscles are all stuck together. I am very uncomfortable. However, I am stuck in this position while the memory of a conversation with my husband is fresh in my mind. We were reminiscing about our early life together in New York City. “Do you recall?” I asked. “No,” he said. “I don’t recall.” “We were just two blocks away from Central Park,” I said. “And I would go into the park with Mongol dogs!” I said. “Many people do that,” my husband said. “They go into the park with their dogs.” “And I would pick up cigarette butts!” I said. “Why?” my husband asked. “It’s not as if there wasn’t enough to eat at home!” My husband added. “She just wanted to meet the pygmies!” shouted a boy who was walking down the street who was carrying a baguette under his arm. “She’s an American!” shouted the boy’s father. “She can do what she wants!” Nevertheless, I wonder if there is a method to my madness. You see, I am a resourceful person. Today, I repaired a tear in the hem of a silk dress that I had just picked up from the dry cleaners that I had taken there because I had spilled spaghetti sauce on it—the color of the sauce is similar to the color of the plush carpet in the lobby of the apartment building where I live. I do not have any children. I have this torn garment that I will keep on a rack in my closet until I have a pile. Then I will take it to the tailor. I will pay cash. I will have it altered. I will pick it up. I will bring it home. I will not put it in the pile. I will hang it with a bunch of other clothes that I like and that I often wear. And I will not apologize for any of it.',\n",
       " 'The boy told his mother that he had been accosted on the street by a man who pulled out a knife and demanded his wallet. The boy said he did not have any money with him, so the man apologized and walked away. Now, this was picturesque—a bolero-like arc the blade made in the air, and the beady-eyed monster withdrawing into the fog as if it, the fog, were his home. I am not saying the boy was a cheater, but his mother had a hard time believing his story. She said, “You just made this up!” And she added, “Furthermore, you never say ‘good morning’ to me!” Nevertheless, the boy stuck to his story. He persisted. Many of Ms. Williams’s people are unremitting in their demands. The boy’s persistence—coupled with his expression of urgency—transformed his mother’s attitude toward him. She recalled a time when she and her husband both desired the boy—before she and his father were married. She and the boy’s father had been sweethearts in high school and she became pregnant with the boy. They were not married, but eventually they were married. The boy’s father selected the wedding ring. The centerpiece of their household was a grandfather clock that the boy’s father had repaired himself. The boy’s movements are large and fluid as he moves around his home. He is muscular and he has short, wavy hair. He is the image of his father. His father had done the repairing on the clock with a little tiny hammer and a chisel. There are many people who can do that kind of work. It is not highly specialized work. The important thing is that the work was done and that the clock continued to keep good time.明',\n",
       " 'I saw Mr. Foxx at his window today, like he was on an excursion. Mr. Foxx is one of many scorpions who live in the neighborhood. Today, the sky was very blue and the clouds were very white and Mr. Foxx was wearing a dark suit and a short-sleeved shirt. I am very familiar with his cheerful disposition. Mr. Foxx’s late wife, Lillian, recently died. In the street, a dog barked and a bird called—loud, mechanical noises. There are plenty of places where a person can go to be alone these days. Why wouldn’t Mr. Foxx have the window open? It was hot. And why wouldn’t he be at ease in his own home? Why wouldn’t he smile? I once heard Mr. Foxx say, “I don’t sleep very well.” I had a rendezvous with a memory of Mr. Foxx’s face as I was making coffee this morning. It’s the kind of coffee I like, with a very small amount of cream. Mr. Foxx’s eyes are very dark and very large and his hair is gray and neatly combed. I recall his shoulders and his beady eyes. I saw his shadow on the wall. Last spring I spent a month in the country and when I returned to the city I saw Mr. Foxx in the park. Mr. Foxx was also flanked by a dog. I said, “Good morning!” The dog wagged his tail and Mr. Foxx said, “Good morning!” Then I kept on walking and the dog kept on barking. Aromatic clouds from a hot dog vendor soon filled the air. The cloud lifted and then it pooled over the vendor’s head. It was a very personal cloud. Another cloud server who wields a large, red paddle—she serves up pancakes, waffles, and eggs at a luncheonette where I sometimes go. She strikes a counter with the paddle and she calls out to me, “What do you want?” And I say, “I’ll have a coffee and a chestnut cake, please.” I often have coffee and cake for breakfast. The chestnut cake is dry and crumbly and not very sweet. It is filled with hardly any chestnut paste. It is a wonder that I ever go back to the coffee shop for more of the same. בעל חי! איך איך איך!',\n",
       " 'The dog’s tail began to wag enthusiastically when the dog saw me approach—as if I was the only one the dog wanted to see. The dog’s friendliness was widespread, but his affection for me was both circumstantial and intense. I am often drawn to, and helped by, people who are ordinary-looking and who offer me practical assistance. This ability to help people is a gift, a talent. I am a beady-eyed person, but I am not malicious. The woman who owns the dog told the dog to get up on the coffee table and the coffee table is very close to the ceiling. Why? Because there isn’t much space in the room we are in. There isn’t much room to swing a cat. And the woman lavished attention on the coffee table by polishing the surface with a soft cloth. I heard her say to the dog, “You are a good boy!” And, “That’s right!” I, myself, have two large, fluffy dogs at home—big, friendly giants—who shed hair like snow. My husband doesn’t mind the dogs one bit. He is very tolerant. You see, the place where we live is in the country and there is plenty of room here for our house, a shed, the stable, the dog fancy and for the giants to roam. The giant who is a bitch—she is a shy, contented sort of person who eats like a horse and who does not have very good eyesight. She came to me from a pound. The giant who is a dog—he is a big, irresponsible, cheerful, hard-working horse’s ass who never does what he is told. He can be an affectionate oaf. He came to me from a newspaper advertisement. My husband found the ad. The advertisement said, “Happy, healthy young dog seeks active home.” We went to see the young dog, but we took along our old, female dog, who is also big and fluffy, and she started barking at the young dog. That’s when I started calling out for help! I said, “She’s friendly! She’s strong!” Nevertheless, we left the young dog and we went on to another place where we saw many more dogs. I don’t recall how many places we visited or how many dogs we saw before we selected the young, large, water-loving New Yorker who can swim like a horse. The young dog who can swim—he has style, but he is no genius. He has a good appetite and he is easily pleased. He puts his paws on my shoulders in the morning and he licks my face. What more could a woman want? My husband says, “See how happy she is!” And then my husband will put his arm around me. The thing is—I barely recall how we got together, how we became a couple. My husband’s affair with a younger woman—I just threw that on the pyre. I didn’t set the woods on fire with it. I found out about the affair from a mutual friend. The woman that my husband had an affair with—she is a server at a restaurant. She is an equestrian. She helps people who are disabled get on and off horses. My husband and I, we went to the same place to pick up our prescription eyeglasses and we both chose tortoiseshell frames. Our eyes are not as good as they once were, but we are both stuck with these frames. My husband says, “I don’t recall ever not having you in my life.” And I say, “Well, I can do better.” You see, there are a lot of lonely people in the world.',\n",
       " 'On a day when the sky was gray-pure and the streets were wet, I recall being very happy in a room with a direction-finding clock. It was my apartment and the place where I stashed a big, round cake that was covered with white frosting and sprinkled with many toasted, chopped almonds. The cake had been made to order according to my specifications. It was not easily broken and it was very rich. I had selected the flavor of the filling also—raspberry. I had paid cash for it and I had picked it up. Nevertheless, I didn’t eat any of it. I had put a slice of it on a plate and placed that in the center of my coffee table. I put a fork and a knife alongside the slice. I put a napkin on the table near the centerpiece. And a cigarette lighter and an ash tray. There was a space on the coffee table for a cup of coffee that I was about to go and get. I planned to eat the cake—in the scorch marks of the sunshine. There was a reason why I had created this tableau vivant. There was a reason why I had gone to the bakery and ordered the cake. I had a rendezvous with a man who often gave me the cold shoulder. Just before his arrival, I went into my bedroom closet and put on a brand new, soft, flimsy, flesh-colored, torn-up-around-the-seam, one-shoulder dress. I stuck my head through the ceiling hole and said, “This is how well I’m doing!”—meaning, at least I can do that!—when what I really wanted was to express my own burgeoning emotions to a seemingly uninterested man. The bell rang. There he was. And the torn-up seam, it sprang open and a bit of my flesh was revealed. I abruptly pulled the material together. Later, I threw the dress in the trash. I took a swallow of coffee and then I ate some of the cake. It was delicious. I am not easily fooled. This is not funny. I may have a gift, but what good is it? Before long, a woman in the building called to say that she had tried to reach me earlier and that it was important. I didn’t want to talk to her. I hung up on her. I had just fired my maid and I couldn’t pay the rent. However, I had this golden-brown hue—just like the color of the coffee that I had made. And I was svelte. And I was strong. I can’t help it. I am a survivor. My muscles are big and my bones are hard. I am a modern woman. I am an American. I am an animal. I am not a type. I am the type. I am on exhibit at the museum. You can come and see me. Admission is free.',\n",

You see, there are so many people with the same names. It’s hard to keep track. The woman’s eyes narrowed. She said, “No, it is definitely ‘Arthur.’ And he created the rug. He beat the design into the surface of the carpet with a smooth-faced hammer. He went ‘tick, toc, tick, genteel’—until the pattern emerged.

I have a talent for making incisions. I am an adept. I am an artist. Before long, I will have a pile of this sort of work for posterity. My work is picturesque, prolific, political, timely, humorous, indomitable, important, modest, moral, philosophical, patriotic, religious, revolutionary, sentimental, sexual, social, sporting, tragic, and joyful. And you can put a period at the end of that.']"
