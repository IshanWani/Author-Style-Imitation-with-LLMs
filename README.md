This project explores fine-tuning large language models to imitate an individual author’s writing style. The system learns stylistic patterns such as tone, structure, and phrasing, and generates text that closely matches the target author’s voice.

Key aspects include dataset curation for stylistic consistency, systematic hyperparameter and model configuration optimization, and qualitative evaluation through iterative feedback loops. The focus is on improving coherence, stylistic fidelity, and practical usability of generated text.
